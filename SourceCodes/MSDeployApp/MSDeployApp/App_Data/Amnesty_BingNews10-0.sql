Samia''s father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid and her first husband Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel are accused of killing the 28-year-old from Bradford while on a visit to Pakistan. The pair appeared in court in Jhelum in Pakistan''s northern Punjab province on Saturday (17 September), but it was a brief hearing after prosecutor Najful Hussain Shah applied for more time to gather evidence. He said Samia''s mother and sister tricked her into visiting Pakistan in July by saying her father was gravely ill and that the women fled to Britain after her murder, according to AP reports. Shah added that the Pakistani government is trying to bring them back for questioning. Speaking to reporters outside the court, he also confirmed he will seek the death penalty for both men. When Samia died on 27 July, her family declared she died of a heart attack and buried her in eastern Pakistan. However , when her second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazim suspected it was an "honour killing" following their marriage, he urged Pakistani authorities to investigate and publicly accused Samia''s family of being responsible for her death. A Pakistani police investigation concluded that Samia''s father stood guard while Shakeel raped her, before the two men strangled her to death. A post-mortem examination confirmed she died from strangulation. Police sources in Pakistan claim Shakeel admitted the murder in an interview saying, "I strangled Samia to death using a dupatta [a scarf]." Both men are yet to enter pleas however, BBC Pakistan correspondent Shaimaa Khalil said Shahid "flatly denied" any involvement in his daughter''s death as he entered court on Saturday (17 September). "For the first time since his arrest, Muhammad Shahid responded to media questions about her death," Khalil said, according to the BBC.

  NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet  is scheduled to consider a bill that proposes introduction of an additional definition of "murder" under the Indian Penal Code  proposing stringent measures to deter elders from taking part in decisions of khap panchayats  ordering honour killings  at its meeting on Thursday.
  
  <br />After weighing between the ordinance route and amendment to the IPC  and related laws governing the procedure in the criminal justice system, the home ministry felt that the latter method would be more effective in deterring the khap panchayats from ordering killing of young couples marrying within the gotra.
  <br />
  <br />The Indian Penal Code & Certain Other Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010, proposes to introduce "fifthly" clause to Section 300 of IPC which at present defines "murder" under four categories. The proposed additional definition would make khap dictated honour killings a distinct offence and would make all those who participate in the decision liable to be tried for the main charge, that is murder. This would make him liable for the maximum penalty that is death sentence.
  <br />
  <br />Under the present legal regime, anyone participating in a khap panchayat could at best be roped in for being a party to the conspiracy that generally attracts a maximum punishment ranging from five years to life term.
  <br />
  <br />The other four categories of culpable homicide amounting to murder already defined under Section 300 are:
  <br />
  <br />* if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death
  <br />
  <br />* secondly, if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused
  <br />
  <br />* thirdly, if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death
  <br />
  <br />* fourthly, if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid
  <br />
  <br />The spate of honour killings in Delhi and Haryana had ushered in the `immediacy'' along with ''necessity'' for laws to be tuned to meet the kangaroo courts.
  <br />
  <br />The Cabinet is also likely to consider the proposed changes to other laws, including the Indian Evidence Act and Hindu Marriage Act, for remedial measures to protect innocent young couples and deter the khap panchayats. It proposes to define in clear terms what offending action constitute "perceived dishonour" and "dishonour".
  <br />
  <br />The likely changes in the laws intend to act stringently against those taking a decision to socially boycott young couples and their parents in the name of breach of social norm.
  <br />
  <br />The Cabinet is also likely to consider amending the existing laws to provide for deterrent punishment to those who parade a woman naked in the streets of a village terming her as a witch. At present such crimes are punishable under Section 354 of IPC for outraging the modesty of a woman and attracts a modest punishment of two years imprisonment.

Police arrested the father and brother of a 19-year-old Hindu woman Friday on suspicion of murdering her and her 23-year-old lover, both from the lowest Dalit caste. The relatives allegedly strangled the couple after catching them having sex at their home in Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh state, police said. "We have arrested the father and brother of the girl. They told us they killed them because she had brought disrepute to the family," Bhushan Verma, investigating officer in Shamli, told AFP. "We are investigating to see if there were more relatives involved. Both were strangled to death." It came after another Hindu couple in their 20s were Thursday found dead in nearby Saharanpur district, also in Uttar Pradesh, after their families allegedly objected to their relationship. Police have not ruled out suicide after the couple were found hanging inside the man''s house. "It could be honour killing or suicide. We are waiting for the post mortem reports to confirm the cause of death," Pradeep Kumar Yadav, police chief of Saharanpur, told AFP. Yadav said the couple were in a three year relationship and wanted to marry but faced resistance from both families. Both of the deceased couples were biologically unrelated to one another. However, in each case, the couples belonged to the same "gotra" -- or kinship group -- something considered incestuous by many Hindus despite the lack of biological links, and which can be a cause for such killings. In a third case, police on Thursday found the body of a 16-year-old Muslim boy buried near an edible oil factory in neighbouring Muzaffarnagar district, after he earlier went missing from his home. Police said the teenager was in a relationship with the niece of the factory''s Hindu owner, adding her relatives strangled him to protect the "honour of the family". "We have arrested the girl''s brother, uncle and cousin for the murder," Deepak Kumar, police chief of Muzaffarnagar district, told AFP. Marriages outside one''s caste or religion still attract censure across India. Honour killings -? which often see couples targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationship -? have been carried out for centuries in the country, especially in rural areas. They are typically enacted by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family''s reputation in a hereditary caste system. United Nations statistics suggest 1,000 out of the 5,000 such murders that occur worldwide every year are in India.

<p>Five people from Delhi were sentenced to death on Friday for the ?honor killing? of a couple, the latest in a series of death penalty judgments in India for the murder of young people who wish to marry outside their caste or religious group.</p>
<p>The victims, who belonged to different castes and hoped to get married, were reportedly  tied with ropes and beaten with sticks and pipes before being electrocuted to death in 2010.</p>
<p>?Such cruel and barbaric acts cannot be allowed to take place in developed metropolitan cities,? the sessions judge, Ramesh Kumar Singhal, said while sentencing.</p>
<p>So-called honor killings take place in many parts of India, particularly in the northern states of Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, where caste continues to be a decisive factor in marriage. Young men and women who violate the traditional rules that prohibit marriage outside their own castes and religious communities are regularly ostracized, tortured and sometimes even murdered by members of their family, village or community. On some occasions, self-appointed caste councils, called khap panchayats, pass diktats ordering such attacks, claiming they hope to protect the honor of their communities.</p>
<p>In recent years, India?s highest court has taken a strong position against this practice. ?There is nothing honorable in such?killings,? the Supreme Court said in 2006, ?and in fact they are nothing but barbaric and shameful acts of murder committed by brutal, feudal minded persons who deserve harsh punishment.?</p>
<p>Last year, the court went one step further and prescribed the death sentence to punish those guilty of honor killings, saying it was time to ?stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on our nation.?</p>
<p>?All persons who are planning to perpetrate honor killings should know that the gallows await them,? the court said.</p>
<p>But not all institutions in India agree with the court?s stance. In a report  released in August this year, India?s Law Commission, an advisory body of legal experts, criticized the court?s directive, saying that the death sentence in India is to be used ?only in very exceptional and rare cases,? when ?aggravating and mitigating circumstances? are found.</p>
<p>The commission found that since the decision was given, the lower courts of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi had sentenced almost all accused in cases of honor killings to death. Disapproving of this trend, the commission said that each case needed to be judged on its own facts and circumstances and criticized what it called the Supreme Court?s ?blanket direction? to give the death penalty in all instances of honor killings.</p>
<p>?No hard and fast rule can be laid down,? the report said, in sharp contrast to the court?s decision prescribing the death penalty for honor killings committed ?for whatever reason.?</p>
<p>In the 2011 case decided by the Supreme Court, a man strangled his daughter to death for having a relationship against his will. The court said that if a person is unhappy with the behavior of a relative or a member of his caste, ?the maximum he can do is to cut off social relations,? but he ?cannot take the law into his own hands by committing violence or giving threats of violence.?</p>
<p>India has retained the death penalty, but since the 1980s this extreme form of punishment has been used only in the ?rarest of rare” cases. Statistics show that even where the death penalty is given, execution is uncommon. According to Amnesty International?s recent data , 435 people were sentenced to death in India between 2007 and 2011, but none have been hanged.</p>
<p>Honor killings, which have been under intense media scrutiny, now fall within the ?rarest of rare? category. In a bid to combat the practice more effectively, the government began considering various legal proposals in 2009, including an amendment to the country?s penal code to explicitly mention honor killings. The Law Commission, tasked with evaluating this proposal, advised against it, saying the amendment would cause ?interpretational difficulties.?</p>

<p>Instead, the Law Commission proposed a law to ban the now infamous ?khap panchayats,? which are different from the country?s gram panchayats, or local self-governments. The bodies of community elders have been called ?undemocratic? by the government, and the report labels them a ?pernicious practice.? ?Often young couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the police lines or protection homes to avoid the wrath of kangaroo courts,? the report said.</p>
<p>The proposed law seeks to prohibit any group from gathering ?to deliberate on, or condemn? any legal marriage, ?on the basis that the marriage has dishonored the caste or community tradition or brought disrepute to the family, village or locality.?</p>
<p>The intention of the law, the report said, is to ?curb the social evil of caste councils or panchayats? that endanger the ?life and liberty of young persons.?</p>

The victims, who belonged to different castes and hoped to get married, were reportedly tied with ropes and beaten with sticks and pipes before being electrocuted to death in 2010. ?Such cruel and barbaric acts cannot be allowed to take place in developed metropolitan cities,? the sessions judge, Ramesh Kumar Singhal, said while sentencing. So-called honor killings take place in many parts of India, particularly in the northern states of Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, where caste continues to be a decisive factor in marriage. Young men and women who violate the traditional rules that prohibit marriage outside their own castes and religious communities are regularly ostracized, tortured and sometimes even murdered by members of their family, village or community. On some occasions, self-appointed caste councils, called khap panchayats, pass diktats ordering such attacks, claiming they hope to protect the honor of their communities. In recent years, India?s highest court has taken a strong position against this practice. ?There is nothing honorable in such?killings,? the Supreme Court said in 2006, ?and in fact they are nothing but barbaric and shameful acts of murder committed by brutal, feudal minded persons who deserve harsh punishment.? Last year, the court went one step further and prescribed the death sentence to punish those guilty of honor killings, saying it was time to ?stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on our nation.? ?All persons who are planning to perpetrate honor killings should know that the gallows await them,? the court said. But not all institutions in India agree with the court?s stance. In a report released in August this year, India?s Law Commission, an advisory body of legal experts, criticized the court?s directive, saying that the death sentence in India is to be used ?only in very exceptional and rare cases,? when ?aggravating and mitigating circumstances? are found. The commission found that since the decision was given, the lower courts of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi had sentenced almost all accused in cases of honor killings to death. Disapproving of this trend, the commission said that each case needed to be judged on its own facts and circumstances and criticized what it called the Supreme Court?s ?blanket direction? to give the death penalty in all instances of honor killings. ?No hard and fast rule can be laid down,? the report said, in sharp contrast to the court?s decision prescribing the death penalty for honor killings committed ?for whatever reason.? In the 2011 case decided by the Supreme Court, a man strangled his daughter to death for having a relationship against his will. The court said that if a person is unhappy with the behavior of a relative or a member of his caste, ?the maximum he can do is to cut off social relations,? but he ?cannot take the law into his own hands by committing violence or giving threats of violence.? India has retained the death penalty, but since the 1980s this extreme form of punishment has been used only in the ?rarest of rare” cases. Statistics show that even where the death penalty is given, execution is uncommon. According to Amnesty International?s recent data, 435 people were sentenced to death in India between 2007 and 2011, but none have been hanged. Honor killings, which have been under intense media scrutiny, now fall within the ?rarest of rare? category. In a bid to combat the practice more effectively, the government began considering various legal proposals in 2009, including an amendment to the country?s penal code to explicitly mention honor killings. The Law Commission, tasked with evaluating this proposal, advised against it, saying the amendment would cause ?interpretational difficulties.?

Instead, the Law Commission proposed a law to ban the now infamous ?khap panchayats,? which are different from the country?s gram panchayats, or local self-governments. The bodies of community elders have been called ?undemocratic? by the government, and the report labels them a ?pernicious practice.? ?Often young couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the police lines or protection homes to avoid the wrath of kangaroo courts,? the report said. The proposed law seeks to prohibit any group from gathering ?to deliberate on, or condemn? any legal marriage, ?on the basis that the marriage has dishonored the caste or community tradition or brought disrepute to the family, village or locality.? The intention of the law, the report said, is to ?curb the social evil of caste councils or panchayats? that endanger the ?life and liberty of young persons.?', 5218, N'Keith Bedford for The New York TimesSupporters of journalist Nirupama Pathak, an alleged victim of honor killing, taking part in a candlelight vigil to protest ...', N'Debating the Death Sentence for ‘Honor’ Killings', N'https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/debating-the-death-sentence-for-honor-killings/', N'india.blogs.nytimes.com', N'"Null"', N'https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png', 3500, 3500)

							<p>Souad, a girl from a West Bank village, was 17 when she fell in love. It was a horrific crime according to the local tradition, an extreme disrespect to the family, and punishable by death. She was burned with gasoline by her family members. However, Souad survived miraculously even after 70 per cent burns, with the help of women of her village and a European aid worker. Set in permanent exile from her homeland, she published her story in the form of a book ?Burned Alive? in 2004, which is a true account of a victim of ?honour killing?.</p>
<p>The testimony of Souad is no less horrific than the Nobel-winning stories of Malala Yousafzai or Nadia Murad. It documents insolent brutality and cruelty and is a call to stop a disgraceful tradition called ?Honour Killing?. Certainly, hundreds of thousands of Souads in different corners of the globe are not fortunate enough to experience a magical survival like her.</p>
<p>There was huge outrage in mid-September over the alleged honour killing in Telengana?s Nalgonda district of a 23-year-old Dalit Christian, who had married an upper caste woman. Since time immemorial there has been the practice of honour killing on the pretext of preserving family honour. It happens around the world, mostly in conservative societies and irrespective of race and religion. Honour killing is deeply associated with the sexual activities of women ? it?s utterly unfortunate that these people think that the foundation of their honour is so fragile that it is balanced on the girls? activities. This is certainly the most primitive evidence of gender-based violence recognised in history. Or it might have begun even before recorded history, along with the bondage of patriarchal society.</p>
<p>India?s Supreme Court just struck down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code to decriminalize adultery. However, in mythology, sage Jamadagni?s wife Renuka was attracted to another man, and the sage ordered his son to kill his mother. And sage Parashurama did so. A similar example is found in Greek mythology as well. Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, the legendary hero of the Trojan War, killed his mother Clytaemestra, queen of Argos, to avenge Agamemnon?s death. However, inheritance of the throne was another important issue in that case. The example of Orestes became a benchmark in Greek mythology. For example, in Homer?s Odyssey, while accusing Odysseus? queen Penelope, her son Telemachus was given the example of Orestes.</p>
<p>If we peep into the Middle East, in the pages of the Arabian Nights, the anger of King Shahryar was not pacified even after he killed his adulteress wife. In ancient Rome, the head of the family had the right to kill an adulteress wife or daughter ? a law framed by Augustus Caesar. In ancient China also, a father and a husband had similar rights. In Medieval Europe, the Jews? law had the provision of killing the adulteress wife and her lover by stone pelting. In sixteenth-century Italy, the young poet, Isabella De Mora, was killed by her brothers by knives.</p>
<p>In France, the Napoleonic Code of 1810 bestowed the right to kill adulteress wives on their husbands. The Ottoman Empire, and Jordan and Lebanon were motivated by the French example, and framed similar laws. During the reign of John Calvin in Geneva, an adulteress was punished by drowning in the river Rh?ne. Across the Atlantic, in Aztec and Inca civilizations in North and South America, death penalty was prescribed. Certainly, the outlook of patriarchal societies towards girls is reflected in ?Honour Killing?.</p>
<p>Women, regardless of their class, race or creed and geographical spread, have been treated as the property of men. Wasn?t the killing of Desdemona by Othello, the Moor of Venice, an act of Honor Killing? In a country like Belgium, where adultery is legal for some time now, there was trial of a Pakistani immigrant family in 2011 for such a crime. And in the North American context, David Stanford?s book ?Honor Killing? is written in the background of Hawaii.</p>
<p>According to an UN estimate of 2000, there are 5,000 honor killings every year. Middle-East countries might be the haven for honour killings. Its prevalence is quite high among the Iraqi Kurds. In 2008, a father killed his daughter for allegedly chatting with a male friend on Facebook.</p>
<p>There is a huge culture of honour killing in Kamal Atat?rk?s Turkey ? in her book ?Honor Killing: Stories of Men Who Killed?, Ayse ?nal described the agony of the killers and the victims. Jordan?s horrific situation could be understood from Norma Khouri?s books: ?Forbidden Love? and ?Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern Days Jordan?.</p>
<p>The situation of Pakistan with honour killings is shocking ? they call it ?karo-kari?. The killing of model Qandeel Baloch by her brother in 2016 created huge uproar. However, much like the story of Souad, the most discussed case of Pakistan is that of Saba Qaiser, a 19-year-old girl, who in 2014 survived even after she was shot in the head by her father and was dumped in a river in the Punjab province.</p>

<p>The Indian condition is not very comfortable. NCRB report recorded 251 and 71 cases of honour killings in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Bollywood repeatedly reminded us about Manoj and Babli, who were killed in 2007 for marrying within same clan (gotra) ? e.g. ?Guddu Rangila?, ?NH10?.</p>
<p>Chander Suta Dogra penned ?Manoj and Babli: A Hate Story?. However, Manoj-Babli?s story is either neither the first one nor the last in the history of honour killing of India.

<p>According to WHO, the most tragic consequences of cultural discrimination against girls is killing them in the name of family honour. Human rights organisations often compare it to ?Crimes of Passion? of Latin America or the killing due to dowry in India. The practice of ?Sati? was perhaps another such type of killing ? persuading to suicide is no less than killing in many cases.</p>
<p>In a landmark judgment in 2010, the Karnal District Court pronounced death sentence to five in the case of Manoj and Babli ? first incidence of death penalty for honour killing in India ? while giving a life sentence to the khap head who ordered the killings.</p>

<p>In these cultures reputation is everything. To protect it, people restrict their own behaviour and police their family members to ward off any gossip. Back in the 80s and 90s, the recently arrived Lebanese community in Sydney to which my family belonged, was preoccupied with reputation. It was ironic, the way people tried to sniff out the slightest whiff of scandal in the lives of others, even as they tried to prevent themselves becoming the focus of that week?s gossip.</p><p>As a teenage girl, my life revolved around  ?what people will say.?

What will people say?</p><p>It?s hard to convey to those who have never experienced it, how it feels to be immersed in such a culture. It?s like living in an invisible prison; to the outside world everything appears normal, but the fear of bahadli  -disgrace- consumed so much of our waking moments. Of course, in this particular community in Sydney, which was actually comparatively liberal, the stakes were not quite so high. But if even those of us who grow up in the west can be affected like this, you can only imagine what it must be like to live in places where the honour code is all they know.</p><p>This is what so many westerners, living in a society driven by individualism, have difficulty comprehending: to those cultures in which honour is paramount, nothing else matters, and all family members are expected to play their part.</p><p>As journalist Barbara Kay explains :</p><p>?To understand honour culture, one must think of oneself not as an individual but as a role. You are not John or Julia; you are a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, a father or a mother, a father-in-law or a mother-in-law. Your role dictates your behaviour and your obligations. When one steps out of the prescribed role to act as an individual, the smooth functioning of the family collective is threatened.?</p><p>And this is where it gets dangerous for women. In such deeply patriarchal cultures, the honour of men is found, as the Ecuadorian saying goes, ?between the legs of a woman.? In some ways women are placed on a pedestal, cherished for their ?purity? and ability to be mothers. But -and here is the catch- if they fall from that lofty perch, not only is there no getting back up again, but the reputation of the entire family is irrevocably tarnished.</p><p>And so the role of women is not to do anything that may cast doubt on their purity or modesty. Simply been seen in the company of a man who is not a relative is enough to set the wheels of gossip in motion. Because women are considered the keepers of virtue, the ones who are meant to reign in the uncontrollable desires of men, their failure to do so is seen not only as a terrible transgression, but as a complete failure of them as a person.</p><p>When a woman?s worth is tied up solely in her chastity, what happens when that chastity is compromised? She becomes literally worthless and it is considered no great loss if she is disposed of. </p><p>Make no mistake, this is misogyny in its worst form. Although men are sometimes the victims of honour crimes, the vast majority are young women. Often acting under enormous social pressure, their attackers will claim that the women had to be killed because they were ?too western.? Of course ?too western? is just shorthand for the desire to be free. This should not be exclusive to western countries. Indeed, early Islam afforded women far more freedoms than any Muslim majority country does today. I will never cease to be amazed and dismayed at how a religion rooted in freedom and human rights could be so thoroughly corrupted.</p><p>To this end, any attempt to tackle honour crimes has to be two-fold, the first is to free people from the illusion that what others think of them matters more than all else. I don?t hold much hope that this can be done in countries like Pakistan or much of the Arab world any time soon since many of them appear to be getting more, not less, conservative. But it can certainly be tackled in immigrant communities in the west. That Lebanese community I described above is almost unrecognisable in how far it has progressed in the last twenty years.</p><p>The second is to challenge the status of women as the keepers of virtue. I have written before that nothing has contributed more to the oppression of women than the obsession with virginity.  Women?s lives literally depend on abolishing the notion that sexual virtue is the hallmark of a ?good? woman.</p><p>The insidious nature of patriarchy places the safety and lives of women at risk, and it warps the minds of men. I won?t insult the women who suffer from the threat of such violence by claiming it hurts men as much it hurts women, but the burden of honour costs men too. It costs them knowing who the women in their lives really are, preventing them from having meaningful relationships. It also impacts on their own quality of life. It is no way for anyone to live, to be suspicious of your own family, viewing them as potential sources of disgrace rather than individuals, and to wallow in constant fear of ?what people will say.?</p><p>Honour crimes are on the rise and more than ever, we need to heed the words Hillary Clinton spoke in her 1995 UN address: ?Women?s rights are human rights,? because improving the status of women, improves the lives of everyone.</p>', 7296, N'Pakistani Mohammad Iqbal holds up an image of his wife Farzana Parveen, who was allegedly beaten to death with bricks by her father and other family members for marrying a man of her own choice, in Chak 367.

In some ways women are placed on a pedestal, cherished for their ?purity? and ability to be mothers. But -and here is the catch- if they fall from that lofty perch, not only is there no getting back up again, but the reputation of the entire family is irrevocably tarnished. And so the role of women is not to do anything that may cast doubt on their purity or modesty. Simply been seen in the company of a man who is not a relative is enough to set the wheels of gossip in motion. Because women are considered the keepers of virtue, the ones who are meant to reign in the uncontrollable desires of men, their failure to do so is seen not only as a terrible transgression, but as a complete failure of them as a person. When a woman?s worth is tied up solely in her chastity, what happens when that chastity is compromised? She becomes literally worthless and it is considered no great loss if she is disposed of.  Make no mistake, this is misogyny in its worst form. Although men are sometimes the victims of honour crimes, the vast majority are young women. Often acting under enormous social pressure, their attackers will claim that the women had to be killed because they were ?too western.? Of course ?too western? is just shorthand for the desire to be free. This should not be exclusive to western countries. Indeed, early Islam afforded women far more freedoms than any Muslim majority country does today. I will never cease to be amazed and dismayed at how a religion rooted in freedom and human rights could be so thoroughly corrupted. To this end, any attempt to tackle honour crimes has to be two-fold, the first is to free people from the illusion that what others think of them matters more than all else. I don?t hold much hope that this can be done in countries like Pakistan or much of the Arab world any time soon since many of them appear to be getting more, not less, conservative. But it can certainly be tackled in immigrant communities in the west. That Lebanese community I described above is almost unrecognisable in how far it has progressed in the last twenty years. The second is to challenge the status of women as the keepers of virtue. I have written before that nothing has contributed more to the oppression of women than the obsession with virginity. Women?s lives literally depend on abolishing the notion that sexual virtue is the hallmark of a ?good? woman. The insidious nature of patriarchy places the safety and lives of women at risk, and it warps the minds of men. I won?t insult the women who suffer from the threat of such violence by claiming it hurts men as much it hurts women, but the burden of honour costs men too. It costs them knowing who the women in their lives really are, preventing them from having meaningful relationships. It also impacts on their own quality of life. It is no way for anyone to live, to be suspicious of your own family, viewing them as potential sources of disgrace rather than individuals, and to wallow in constant fear of ?what people will say.? Honour crimes are on the rise and more than ever, we need to heed the words Hillary Clinton spoke in her 1995 UN address: ?Women?s rights are human rights,? because improving the status of women, improves the lives of everyone.', 6765, N'honour killings? as she made her way to a courtroom in Lahore, Pakistan.

From the victim''s name, it doesn''t seem he was Muslim, another strike against his continuing to remain alive after taking a female Muslim partner. Several women in the household, including Irsan’s wife and another daughter, apparently helped him carry out his murderous plans. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Irsan had killed another son-in-law nearly two decades ago. Over 17,000 homicides were committhd in the US in 2017 according to statistics released by the FBI last September. So what difference does it make if another murderer is tried and sentenced to death? There is a vast difference.  Murders can occur for many reasons, and a murder victim is just as dead no matter what the reason, but this was a case of honor killing, meaning that the murderer was continuing a tradition prevalent throughout the Islamic world - where it does not raise eyebrows and is often considered to be justified homicide.

One night in late November, Rasha Abu Ara, a 32-year-old mother of five, was beaten to death and strung from a gnarled tree branch as a gruesome badge of “family honor” restored. The woman’s alleged sin was adultery, and her killer was either her own brother or husband, security sources told Reuters. Both are behind bars while an investigation continues. Her murder brought to 27 the number of women slain in similar circumstances in Palestinian-run areas this year, according to rights groups - more than twice last year’s victims. The rise has led Palestinians to question hidebound laws they say are lax on killers, as well as a reluctance to name and shame in the media and society, which may contribute to a feeling of impunity among perpetrators. “It feels like something that belongs to another time,” said one young man in Aqqaba who refused to give his name, the first hints of a beard on his chin. “But, it’s standard.” A week after the crime, Aqqaba mayor Jamal Abu Ara, who is a member of the victim’s extended family, and his brothers sat in their village home, smoking cigarettes and choosing their words carefully. “This act has no religion - it comes from closed, tribal thinking left over from an age of ignorance. People here are walking around in a haze; they want to know who did it and why. Of course, it’s the first time it’s happened here,” he said. His brother added: “Islam requires you have four witnesses to prove the act of adultery. “It’s not right what happened. Especially since if it were a man, some would just say ‘boys will be boys’,” he said. A representative of the slain woman’s family declined to speak to Reuters. “Honour killing” is a social menace that occurs throughout the Middle East, though precise figures are often elusive. In neighboring Jordan, for example, a Cambridge University survey of attitudes among young people published in June found that a third of respondents agreed with the practice. The researchers attributed the result to low levels of education and “patriarchal and traditional world views, emphasis placed on female virtue and a more general belief that violence against others is morally justified.” The study estimated an average of 15 to 20 such killings occur every year in Jordan, with a population of around 6.3 million, compared to around 4 million in Palestinian lands. PATRIARCHY Some activists believe the rise in honour killings indicates social and economic problems are mounting in the territories, where Palestinians exercise limited self-rule but Israel holds ultimate sovereignty, including over commerce. But Soraida Hussein, whose rights group Muntada tallied this year’s killings, said the practice also has deep roots. “There is no balance in power relations between the genders. There is a patriarchal mentality...as always, the force and pressure in society is transferred from the strong to the weak,” she said. Palestinian female participation in the labor force stands at 17 percent, a figure the World Bank called “abysmally low,” noting that employers appeared to favor men, among whom joblessness was almost a third lower in 2013. Hussein said that most of the killings related to “the movement and the freedom of the woman, so (perpetrators) say it’s an ‘honour killing ‘... also, there’s still no clear law to discourage the practice.” Many of the cases had economic underpinnings, such as connections to disputes over inheritance, or may have been committed to cover up incest, she added. The passing of stricter laws on violence against women is hamstrung by the absence of a Palestinian parliament, which has not met since President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party and the Islamist Hamas group fought a brief, bloody civil war in 2007. Abbas has used his executive power to amend or cancel parts of the penal law, but has not yet changed all legislation which applies a separate status to domestic violence and has been used to justify killings and lighten prison sentences. Palestinian Minister of Women’s Affairs Rabiha Diab saved much of her blame for violence toward women for Israel: “The Israeli occupation is the one practising the utmost violence ... it’s the main thing keeping us from advancing. “There’s been a deterioration, financial and psychological pressure on our society, poverty.

BANISHED Not just laws but lawmakers may be part of the problem. Residents of the northern West Bank village of Deir al-Ghusun began muttering about Thamar Zeidan, a 32-year-old mother of two, after an apparently intoxicated man was spied leaving her home one morning, a local source told Reuters. Elders, including a Hamas member of parliament, soon gathered and signed an announcement formally banishing her family from the larger tribe. The notice was pasted on the outer walls of homes and on the village mosque. Days later in late September, Thamar was choked to death with a metal wire in her sleep. Her father confessed to the deed.

Honor killings in Pakistan are so commonplace they have become something of a media cliche. There are nearly a thousand reported cases every year and, eventually, each becomes a number stripped of humanity. The details may change, but not the reasons for the crime or the impotent outrage of a limited section of society. <br />
At the end of November, police found a young couple buried in a graveyard in Pakistan?s most cosmopolitan city, Karachi. They were 22-year-old Haseena Bibi and 24-year-old Abdul Hadi, who had entered into a free-will marriage. They were from Kohistan, in a relatively remote corner of the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which is infamous for another unsolved honor killing.<br />
In 2012, shaky mobile phone footage of five girls and a boy from Kohistan dancing and singing in their home surfaced on the Internet. After reports that the girls and brothers of the boy in the video had been killed on the orders of a jirga ? an informal dispute resolution assembly of community elders ? the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the case. Five years later, there is no concrete evidence of whether the girls are still alive, or whether they have been murdered, as if their lives never mattered.<br />
Haseena and Abdul were found, however, thanks to a tip-off five days after they were murdered, buried in gunny sacks. They too had been killed on the orders of a jirga. Sixteen people, including the groom?s father, have been charged under anti-terrorism laws and for aggravated murder, which carries the death penalty. <br />
A police officer told local news channel Geo TV: ?The parents and brothers of the couple live in Nawab Colony. When I went to investigate, they confessed that in the jirga both the parties decided to kill the man and woman.?<br />
Activists who campaign against honor crimes use the phrase, ?There is no honor in honor killing.? Media groups insist that honor crimes should be prefaced with ?so-called.? What then is the opposite? A shame killing? Do names and nomenclature matter to the dead, to killers forgiven by families, or to a family where abstract honor is more important than red-blooded life?<br />
In 2014, I interviewed Maqsood Ahmed in Central Jail Gujranwala while he was on trial for attempting to kill his own daughter, Saba, after she had married a neighbor?s son against his wishes. He had lured her to a secluded spot and, along with his brother, shot her, stuffed her limp body in a gunny sack and tossed her into a canal. Saba?s survival is a remarkable story, which was later turned into an award-winning documentary film by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.

What stayed with me, as much as Saba?s fierce strength, was her father?s implacability behind bars. He said that, in trying to kill his own daughter, he was sending a message to all the girls in his family the perils of individual choice. ?[Being in jail], it?s a life of honor. I haven?t committed a crime. I haven?t robbed anyone,? he said. Saba later forgave her father and he was released from custody, as provisions in Pakistani law allow for perpetrators to be set free if the victim or heirs of the victim agree to reconcile.<br />
Last year, the Pakistani Parliament passed a law aimed at curbing honor crimes, making it harder for families to forgive killers.<br />
But lawyer Asad Jamal argues that tying up legal loopholes does not take care of the sociopolitics. ?Women are weak and the whole justice system is tilted against the weak ? poor men, women and children. Women victims of violence need social and state support, whether it is financial or procedural,? he said.<br />
Last week, I interviewed politician Nafisa Shah, who has written a multi-disciplinary study of honor crimes. She says honor killing is a modern construct, adding: ?At the end of the day, it is just a cold-blooded, premeditated murder.?<br />
Perhaps the first step toward reducing the number of killings was the nomenclature; the second, criminalizing violence in the name of honor; and the third and most difficult step ? diffusing the notion that life has more worth than honor.<br />

(Shutterstock) The criminal court in Amman on Sunday sentenced two Jordanian men to death for killing their sister in June “to cleanse the family’s honour,” a court official said. “The two men, aged 23 and 20, took their divorced sister, also in her twenties, to the garden of their house and strangled her in June 2013,” in Zarqa, a city northeast of Amman, the official told AFP. “They confessed to killing their sister, who worked in a kindergarten after suspecting that she had behaved badly,” the official said without elaborating. “They said that they wanted to cleanse the family’s honor,” the official added. Murder is punishable by death in Jordan, but in “honor killings” courts usually commute or reduce sentences if the victim’s family requests leniency. Maximum punishment “For the first time in several years, the family of the victim refused to ask the court for leniency, demanding the maximum punishment,” another court official told AFP without giving further details. Between 15 and 20 women die in so-called “honor” murders each year in the kingdom, despite government efforts to curb such crimes.

					  <p>?</p><p>On Sunday, January 29, 2012, two years and seven months after the bodies of four?Canadian women all from the same family were found murdered, after a ten week trial, and after fifteen hours of deliberations, a jury?voted ?guilty? to first degree murder for three other members of the Shafia family.</p><p>Although I myself initially hailed this as possibly a? turning point  [1]?in? Canada ?in terms of?the nation?s failed multicultural policy, I now wonder why the life sentence, which in? Canada ?means 25 years without parole, was not 25 years without parole for each life coldly snuffed out.</p><p>The?three?Shafias were tried under Canadian law for premeditated murder and for conspiracy to commit murder; no special ?honor killing? related law was needed. This is as it should be and yet, if such a special law did exist, there might have been an ?enhanced penalty? which?might?have maximized the sentences. However, Canadian law in general is lenient. They have no death penalty and there has been no capital punishment in? Canada ?since 1962.</p><p>Still, true justice should have resulted in a 25 year sentence for each murder: one for Geeti, 13, one for Sahar, 17, one for Zainab, 19, and one for Rona Amir Mohammed, 52, instead of what amounts to about?a minimum of?6? years for each life taken.</p><p>Nevertheless, the case was vigorously pursued by the Canadian authorities on behalf of justice for four freedom-loving Muslim girls and women.</p><p>The Shafias are a?prosperous?family of polygamous Afghan immigrants who fled? Afghanistan ?in 1992, took up residence in various Arab states and in? South Africa , and then came to? Canada ?in 2007.</p><p>Clearly, this was an honor killing and one that a biological mother, biological father, and biological older brother perpetrated. By definition, according to my own studies in? Middle East Quarterly  [2], the classic honor killing is that of a young daughter by her family of origin. This is not at all like Western domestic violence or even Western?domestically violent?femicide. Judeo-Christian families of origin in the West do not conspire to kill their young daughters because they are behaving in modern, western ways, i.e., are dressing in Western clothing, mingling with infidels, planning on higher educations, going on dates, attending parties, expecting to marry someone of their own choosing, etc.</p><p>These are all considered crimes of honor, which ?dishonor? their families ? and if intimidation, beatings, isolation, and stalking (all of which applied in the Shafia household) fail, daughters may then be honor killed.</p><p>Khatera Siddiqui (2006) in Kingston, Aqsa Parvez (2007) in Toronto, Amina Said and Sarah Said in Dallas (2008), Nour al-Maliki in Arizona (2009 ), and the three Shafia girls and one Shafia woman (2009) all committed such ?crimes,? including refusing to wear hijab and refusing to marry a first cousin. All were murdered by their fathers or by their fathers and brothers. In two instances, their mothers lured them home.</p><p>This is even more true in? Europe , where honor killing victims are viciously tortured to set an example to other daughters that this is what will happen to them if they disobey tribal and religious customs.</p><p>Although Hindus also commit honor killings, they do so infrequently in the West. Some?Sikhs have perpetrated honor killings in? Canada . One such high-profile case involved a British Colombian mother who sent her daughter abroad in 2000 where she arranged for?her contract killing. Today, more than a decade later,? Canada ?has issued an arrest warrant for the mother, Malkiat Kaur, to be extradited to? India ?to stand trial for the murder of Jaswinder ?Jassi? Kaur and for the attempted murder of Jassi?s beloved husband. Jassi?s crime? She fell in love with a social inferior and dared to marry him.</p><p>Some Muslim immigrants in the West still behave as if they are still living in Afghanistan ,? Pakistan ,? Turkey , the Maghreb,?or on the? West Bank . According to my 2010 study, 91% of the honor killings in the West were Muslim-on-Muslim crimes. Yes, this includes the honor murder of wives by their husbands and with the help of both their in-laws and their own family of origin. This is another kind of honor killing. These poor souls are almost double the age of the daughter-group. I discuss this in the 2010 study.</p><p>It is important to note that for the first time the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal did cover an honor killing case which involved Muslim perpetrators?in? North America . In the past, they failed to do so ? or they? focused on Hindu honor killings  [3]?committed in? India .</p><p>However, the? Wall Street Journal  [4], the? New York Times  [5],? CNN  [6],? BBC  [7], and the? Washington Post  [8] ?all shied away from using the term ?Muslim,? but did indicate that the perpetrators of these honor killings were ?Afghans? and ?immigrants?; they sometimes utilized the term honor killing but usually either in quotes or preceded by the phrase ?so-called.?</p><p>The? Huffington Post  [9]?has published more than twenty articles in the last 24 hours on this trial. A quick review suggests that very few articles use the word ?Muslim.? Some of the journalists include? Supriya Dwivedi  [10],? Danielle Crittenden  [11],? Stephanie Levitz  [12], and? Ayaan Hirsi Ali  [13]. My Canadian colleague, Farzana Hassan, uses the word ?Muslim? and addresses the cultural and religious tradition of honor killings:</p><p>Regrettably, far too many men raised in patriarchal settings regard their female offspring as liabilities. The birth of a female child is often marked with anxiety and dismay. Later on, the issue of family honour kicks in when the girl reaches puberty. In fact, the notion of honour revolves primarily around women and their sexuality and conduct. The men in the family are rarely subjected to the kinds of constraints their female relatives endure. It is mostly when the conduct of the women is perceived as dishonourable that matters worsen.</p><p>Interestingly, Ayaan Hirsi Ali does not use the word ?Muslim? as she opines on this case. But she does make an important point, namely, that American justice may lag behind Canadian justice. Hirsi Ali cites the? Arizona ?case of?Faleh Almaleki, who was only convicted of ?murder in the second degree.? However, Almaleki received a sentence of 34 years ? and for only one murder, not for four. An additional point that one must make concerns? Arizona ?s failure to charge Noor?s mother as a co-conspirator.? Texas ?made the same mistake in the Said case, as did? Canada ?in the Parvez case.</p><p>There has been something of a silence, at least so far, on the part of the various North American Muslim associations.</p><p>However, CAIR?s Canadian chapter did a? television interview  [14]?about the Shafia case in 2011 in which its very seriously hijabbed representative, Maryam Dadabhoy, argued against the use of the term ?honor killing.? She compared it to ?domestic violence? and pointed out that far more incidents of domestic violence are occurring in? Canada ?and elsewhere than are??racialized??honor killings.</p><p>But, as I have shown, the two are not the same and in any event, if we are talking about the West, or about North America, there are many more non-Muslims and non-immigrants living here and thus, of course, more incidents of domestic violence would occur as a mere matter of demographics. If we looked at? Pakistan ?or? Afghanistan , we would see a very different fact pattern.</p><p>Interestingly, Al Jazeera in English released few statements about the trial, but in its? live coverage of the verdict  [15], the reporter used the term ?Muslim? and seemed supportive of the ruling.</p><p>Why do I obsess about the use of the word ?Muslim?? I do so because too many Westerners are confusing this simple descriptor with an insult; too many Westerners have been intimidated by false concepts of politically correct, anti-racism into never describing a Muslim as anything other than a victim. Well, there actually are four Muslim victims in the Shafia case and they are all female.

You can say it, telling the non-politically correct truth: Muslims are bringing their honor killing ''tradition'' to the West. And that means Canada and the USA. Prof. Phyllis Chesler INN:PC Prof. Phyllis Chesler The writer, a Shillman-Ginsburg Fellow at the Middle East Forum and recipient of the 2013 National Jewish Book Award, is the author of sixteen books, including Women and Madness, Woman''s Inhumanity to Woman, and The New Anti-Semitism. She has written four studies about honor killing, Her latest books are An American Bride in Kabul, (Palgrave Macmillan) and Living History: On The Front Lines for Israel and the Jews.Professor Chesler may be reached at her website www.phyllis-chesler.com More from the author ► On Sunday, January 29, 2012, two years and seven months after the bodies of four Canadian women all from the same family were found murdered, after a ten week trial, and after fifteen hours of deliberations, a jury voted ?guilty? to first degree murder for three other members of the Shafia family. Although I myself initially hailed this as possibly a turning point [1] in Canada in terms of the nation?s failed multicultural policy, I now wonder why the life sentence, which in Canada means 25 years without parole, was not 25 years without parole for each life coldly snuffed out. The three Shafias were tried under Canadian law for premeditated murder and for conspiracy to commit murder; no special ?honor killing? related law was needed. This is as it should be and yet, if such a special law did exist, there might have been an ?enhanced penalty? which might have maximized the sentences. However, Canadian law in general is lenient. They have no death penalty and there has been no capital punishment in Canada since 1962. Still, true justice should have resulted in a 25 year sentence for each murder: one for Geeti, 13, one for Sahar, 17, one for Zainab, 19, and one for Rona Amir Mohammed, 52, instead of what amounts to about a minimum of 6? years for each life taken. Nevertheless, the case was vigorously pursued by the Canadian authorities on behalf of justice for four freedom-loving Muslim girls and women. The Shafias are a prosperous family of polygamous Afghan immigrants who fled Afghanistan in 1992, took up residence in various Arab states and in South Africa, and then came to Canada in 2007. Clearly, this was an honor killing and one that a biological mother, biological father, and biological older brother perpetrated. By definition, according to my own studies in Middle East Quarterly [2], the classic honor killing is that of a young daughter by her family of origin. This is not at all like Western domestic violence or even Western domestically violent femicide. Judeo-Christian families of origin in the West do not conspire to kill their young daughters because they are behaving in modern, western ways, i.e., are dressing in Western clothing, mingling with infidels, planning on higher educations, going on dates, attending parties, expecting to marry someone of their own choosing, etc. These are all considered crimes of honor, which ?dishonor? their families ? and if intimidation, beatings, isolation, and stalking (all of which applied in the Shafia household) fail, daughters may then be honor killed. Khatera Siddiqui (2006) in Kingston, Aqsa Parvez (2007) in Toronto, Amina Said and Sarah Said in Dallas (2008), Nour al-Maliki in Arizona (2009 ), and the three Shafia girls and one Shafia woman (2009) all committed such ?crimes,? including refusing to wear hijab and refusing to marry a first cousin. All were murdered by their fathers or by their fathers and brothers. In two instances, their mothers lured them home. This is even more true in Europe, where honor killing victims are viciously tortured to set an example to other daughters that this is what will happen to them if they disobey tribal and religious customs. Although Hindus also commit honor killings, they do so infrequently in the West. Some Sikhs have perpetrated honor killings in Canada. One such high-profile case involved a British Colombian mother who sent her daughter abroad in 2000 where she arranged for her contract killing. Today, more than a decade later, Canada has issued an arrest warrant for the mother, Malkiat Kaur, to be extradited to India to stand trial for the murder of Jaswinder ?Jassi? Kaur and for the attempted murder of Jassi?s beloved husband. Jassi?s crime? She fell in love with a social inferior and dared to marry him. Some Muslim immigrants in the West still behave as if they are still living in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, the Maghreb, or on the West Bank. According to my 2010 study, 91% of the honor killings in the West were Muslim-on-Muslim crimes. Yes, this includes the honor murder of wives by their husbands and with the help of both their in-laws and their own family of origin. This is another kind of honor killing. These poor souls are almost double the age of the daughter-group. I discuss this in the 2010 study. It is important to note that for the first time the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal did cover an honor killing case which involved Muslim perpetrators in North America. In the past, they failed to do so ? or they focused on Hindu honor killings [3] committed in India. However, the Wall Street Journal [4], the New York Times [5], CNN [6], BBC [7], and the Washington Post [8] all shied away from using the term ?Muslim,? but did indicate that the perpetrators of these honor killings were ?Afghans? and ?immigrants?; they sometimes utilized the term honor killing but usually either in quotes or preceded by the phrase ?so-called.? The Huffington Post [9] has published more than twenty articles in the last 24 hours on this trial. A quick review suggests that very few articles use the word ?Muslim.? Some of the journalists include Supriya Dwivedi [10], Danielle Crittenden [11], Stephanie Levitz [12], and Ayaan Hirsi Ali [13]. My Canadian colleague, Farzana Hassan, uses the word ?Muslim? and addresses the cultural and religious tradition of honor killings: Regrettably, far too many men raised in patriarchal settings regard their female offspring as liabilities. The birth of a female child is often marked with anxiety and dismay. Later on, the issue of family honour kicks in when the girl reaches puberty. In fact, the notion of honour revolves primarily around women and their sexuality and conduct. The men in the family are rarely subjected to the kinds of constraints their female relatives endure. It is mostly when the conduct of the women is perceived as dishonourable that matters worsen. Interestingly, Ayaan Hirsi Ali does not use the word ?Muslim? as she opines on this case. But she does make an important point, namely, that American justice may lag behind Canadian justice. Hirsi Ali cites the Arizona case of Faleh Almaleki, who was only convicted of ?murder in the second degree.? However, Almaleki received a sentence of 34 years ? and for only one murder, not for four. An additional point that one must make concerns Arizona?s failure to charge Noor?s mother as a co-conspirator. Texas made the same mistake in the Said case, as did Canada in the Parvez case. There has been something of a silence, at least so far, on the part of the various North American Muslim associations. However, CAIR?s Canadian chapter did a television interview [14] about the Shafia case in 2011 in which its very seriously hijabbed representative, Maryam Dadabhoy, argued against the use of the term ?honor killing.? She compared it to ?domestic violence? and pointed out that far more incidents of domestic violence are occurring in Canada and elsewhere than are ?racialized? honor killings. But, as I have shown, the two are not the same and in any event, if we are talking about the West, or about North America, there are many more non-Muslims and non-immigrants living here and thus, of course, more incidents of domestic violence would occur as a mere matter of demographics. If we looked at Pakistan or Afghanistan, we would see a very different fact pattern. Interestingly, Al Jazeera in English released few statements about the trial, but in its live coverage of the verdict [15], the reporter used the term ?Muslim? and seemed supportive of the ruling. Why do I obsess about the use of the word ?Muslim?? I do so because too many Westerners are confusing this simple descriptor with an insult; too many Westerners have been intimidated by false concepts of politically correct, anti-racism into never describing a Muslim as anything other than a victim. Well, there actually are four Muslim victims in the Shafia case and they are all female. In order to honor that truth and hopefully to prevent further such honor killings, we must speak accurately. Not all Muslims honor kill their daughters. But those who do are rarely punished in Muslim-majority countries. Most are ?covered? by Shari?a law and by custom which despises the ways of the infidel. It is important that moderate and modern-oriented mullahs and imams call for the abolition of women?s subordination in mosque sermons. In 2011, the Canadian chapter of CAIR [16] announced that Canadian Muslim leaders should issue a call against domestic violence. In my opinion, this should include an end to the normalized battering of daughters and wives, an end to the overly strict supervision of female behavior, and definitely, an end to murdering female family members. I am not that optimistic. Canadian CAIR [16] has finally issued a statement on the Shafia decision in which, as usual, they mainly point out that ?everyone,? ?all religions? suffer equally from such ?domestic violence? tragedies, etc. Thus, they take absolutely no responsibility for the ways in which Muslims and Muslim immigrants commit a very specific kind of control over women and ultimately kill them when and if their women disobey their Old World tribal, ethnic, and religious customs. Since the verdict has been announced, the lawyer for Hamed Shafia is appealing his guilty verdict [17] on the ground of ?media bias and hearsay evidence.? The lawyers for Hamed?s parents have also vowed to appeal.', 10221, N' Later on, the issue of family honour kicks in when the girl reaches puberty.

<p>A few months after the couple was married, the brothers invited them to their home for lunch and shot and killed them.</p>
<p>Pakistani officials have rallied behind efforts to end a climate of impunity around “honor killing” with the release of a documentary by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy called “ The Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness .”</p>
<p>Unknown iFrame situation</p>
<p>The film presents the story of a Pakistani woman named Saba who was shot in the face by her family and left for dead after she chose to marry for love — and not through a family-arranged marriage as is still common for many across South Asia. Her father, who was involved in the crime, remains unrepentant, and Saba, who was just 19 at the time, has said that she has not forgiven him.</p>
 Death For Defiance 
<p>About 5,000 women are murdered  by their families each year, according to the United Nations. The majority of them are South Asian women who defy their family’s wishes around marriage.</p>
 Advertisement<p>Rafia Asim of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told  ThinkProgress last year that her organization receives information about an average of 30 “honor killings” a month across just over one third of the country’s districts.</p>
<p>“The majority of the cases that we get are not in any newspapers,” Asim said. “The areas that we work in, there are no NGOs there, there are no journalists there anymore, so there’s no news coming out of those areas. The reports that we get [of ‘honor killings’] are the only ones, really.”</p>
<p>In many cases, people are loath to report the crimes committed by their friends or neighbors because they believe that matters of enforcing “honor” should be left up to individual families.</p>
 RELATED: Telling The Stories Of The Victims Of ‘Honor Killings’ 
<p>That’s why Obaid-Chinoy’s effort to highlight “honor killings” — and to personally lobby for an end to impunity for their perpetrators — is so monumental.</p>
 Advertisement<p>One major hurdle to winning justice for the victims of “honor killing” will be to close  a loophole in the law that allows for the family of victims to pardon perpetrators. Since “honor killings” are often committed by family members, few of those who murder in order to maintain their oppressive sense of “honor” ever face charges for their crimes.</p>
<p>The biggest victory would be to get the legislation passed.</p>
<p>“The biggest victory would be to get the legislation passed — to take forgiveness off the table, to have a law that deters killing women in the name of “honor” and for people to realize that this is a serious crime,” the filmmaker told  AFP.</p>
 The Power Of Film 
<p>She said that an Oscar win would further help highlight the issue. Obaid-Chinoy’s win last night is her second Academy Award. In 2012, she won an Oscar for her film “Saving Face” which told the stories of women who were severely injured when extremely corrosive acid was thrown on them, often in acts of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Her win helped bring attention  to more stringent laws for acid burning, a crime which wasn’t explicitly dealt with by the Pakistani judicial system until 2010.</p>
 Advertisement<p>“Women are the most essential part of our society and I believe in their empowerment, protection and emancipation of achieving the shared goal a prosperous and vibrant Pakistan,” Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said  after he met with Obaid-Chinoy earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Social evils can be overcome through an effective partnership between the government and the civil society,” he added after vowing to introduce more stringent laws against “honor killing” in Pakistan.</p>

CREDIT: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP" /><p>Obaid-Chinoy mentioned that promise in her acceptance speech for her Oscar on Sunday. “That is the power of film,” she said.</p>
<p>“This is what happens when determined women get together,” she said. “From Saba, the woman in my film who remarkably survived an “honor killing” and shared her story…to the men who champion women.”   She’s hopeful that that combination of forces can bring about lasting change in Pakistan. More than 8,500 people around the world have signed on to a campaign to call for the passage of the a bill related to “honor killing” which has wallowed in the country’s legislature.</p>
<p>In a video featured alongside the petition, Obaid-Chinoy called on people to back her efforts to end the brutal practice, and “to let people know that ‘honor killing’ is not part of our religion or our culture.”</p>
 Cultural Shift 
<p>“The fact that the film got international acclaim really spearheaded action by the government,” Yasmeen Hassan of Equality Now, an international women’s rights organization told ThinkProgress. “Obaid-Chinoy makes films on subjects that everyone is thinking about but does not know how to act upon. As such, her films give the public a chance to make desired social and legal change.”</p>
<p>She said that the documentary — and the attention it case on the issue of “honor killing” likely helped lead to the sentencing of Zeeshan and Ahsan Butt for the death of their sister and her husband.</p>
<p>Although she was not in favor of the death penalty, Hassan said that the court decision “shows that the Pakistan government is serious about taking strong action to end impunity for crimes against women and girls and to end ‘honor crimes.’”</p>
<p>While accountability and legal reforms are important, she said that a broader cultural shift will have to take place before “honor killings” can become a thing of the past. “Police and judges have to be sensitized to the law,” Hassan said. “There have to be efforts through the education system and through Pakistan’s robust media to change perceptions of gender roles and acceptability of violence against women.”</p>

The Power Of Film She said that an Oscar win would further help highlight the issue. Obaid-Chinoy’s win last night is her second Academy Award. In 2012, she won an Oscar for her film “Saving Face” which told the stories of women who were severely injured when extremely corrosive acid was thrown on them, often in acts of domestic violence. Her win helped bring attention to more stringent laws for acid burning, a crime which wasn’t explicitly dealt with by the Pakistani judicial system until 2010. Advertisement “Women are the most essential part of our society and I believe in their empowerment, protection and emancipation of achieving the shared goal a prosperous and vibrant Pakistan,” Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said after he met with Obaid-Chinoy earlier this month. “Social evils can be overcome through an effective partnership between the government and the civil society,” he added after vowing to introduce more stringent laws against “honor killing” in Pakistan. Obaid-Chinoy mentioned that promise in her acceptance speech for her Oscar on Sunday. “That is the power of film,” she said. “This is what happens when determined women get together,” she said. “From Saba, the woman in my film who remarkably survived an “honor killing” and shared her story…to the men who champion women.”   She’s hopeful that that combination of forces can bring about lasting change in Pakistan. More than 8,500 people around the world have signed on to a campaign to call for the passage of the a bill related to “honor killing” which has wallowed in the country’s legislature. In a video featured alongside the petition, Obaid-Chinoy called on people to back her efforts to end the brutal practice, and “to let people know that ‘honor killing’ is not part of our religion or our culture.” Cultural Shift “The fact that the film got international acclaim really spearheaded action by the government,” Yasmeen Hassan of Equality Now, an international women’s rights organization told ThinkProgress. “Obaid-Chinoy makes films on subjects that everyone is thinking about but does not know how to act upon. As such, her films give the public a chance to make desired social and legal change.” She said that the documentary — and the attention it case on the issue of “honor killing” likely helped lead to the sentencing of Zeeshan and Ahsan Butt for the death of their sister and her husband. Although she was not in favor of the death penalty, Hassan said that the court decision “shows that the Pakistan government is serious about taking strong action to end impunity for crimes against women and girls and to end ‘honor crimes.’” While accountability and legal reforms are important, she said that a broader cultural shift will have to take place before “honor killings” can become a thing of the past. “Police and judges have to be sensitized to the law,” Hassan said. “There have to be efforts through the education system and through Pakistan’s robust media to change perceptions of gender roles and acceptability of violence against women.” Update: This article has been updated to include comments from Yasmeen Hassan.', 6207, N'for murdering their sister and her husband just as a filmmaker from the country was awarded an Oscar for her documentary about so-called “honor killing.', N'Oscar-Winning ‘Honor Killing’ Documentary Demonstrates The Transformational Power Of Film', N'https://thinkprogress.org/oscar-winning-honor-killing-documentary-demonstrates-the-transformational-power-of-film-7220a0f169b0/', N'thinkprogress.org', N'"Null"', N'https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/0tl4DX701lpm9vVu2.jpg?w=800&h=426&crop=1', 3500, 3500)

						<p>Two Pakistani teenagers who tried to elope were brutally murdered by relatives with electric shocks last month as an “honor killing” in the southern port city of Karachi, police confirmed.</p>
<p>The tribal boy and girl accused of falling in love with each other were declared by the local tribal council, or jirga, as a symbol of ?dishonor? on the Pashtun community.</p>
<p>Jirgas are often convened, particularly in conservative rural areas, to settle local disputes especially between poor families. Although they operate outside the law, their rulings of prompt justice, based on centuries-old traditions, are often honored by local officials.</p>
<p>On the orders of the influential tribal council, the teenage girl was murdered first, and the boy was killed the next day. The bodies were buried secretly at night and no funerals took place.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old girl, identified as Bakht Taj, allegedly tried to elope with the 17-year-old boy, identified as Rehman. The couple belonged to the tribal Mohmand clan originally from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) where Pakistan’s army has fought to contain an Islamist militant insurgency that has spread across the northwest during the past several years.</p>
<p>?The innocent souls were tied to a charpai (rope bed) and given electric shocks,? said Aman Marwat, the police officer who arrested the two fathers and two uncles and is pursuing some 30 members of the jirga who have gone into hiding.</p>

<p>The bodies will be exhumed for postmortem examinations on Wednesday, Marwat added.</p>
<p>Senior police superintendent Rao Anwar said that the police learned about the dual murder through an informant. Police arrested the fathers and some relatives of both teens.</p>
<p>The suspects confessed and revealed that a jirga was involved in declaring death sentences for both the victims, Anwar said.</p>
<p>People involved in the killings kept them secret, but the information reached investigators weeks later, triggering a police raid.</p>
<p>?The girl?s side had agreed but not the jirga and they warned that if the two families did not carry out the barbaric deed, their family in their village back home would have to bear the consequences,? said Zia Ur Rehman, a Pakistani journalist who first reported on the case.</p>
<p>Pakistan is regarded as one of the most dangerous places in the world  to be a woman, with 2014 research finding that each day  six women were kidnapped, four were murdered, four were raped and three killed themselves.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 women and girls in the country are murdered in ?honor killings? each year, but conviction rates are close to zero, according to the Aurat Foundation, a human rights group. The true figure is probably higher since many cases go unreported.</p>
<p>The series of gruesome honor killings in Pakistan reached a climax after the deaths of British beautician Samia Shahid and the controversial social-media celebrity.

<p>The court took up the case in January after a year of three high-profile, problematic executions in three states. The court will likely issue a ruling by June. Our hope is that it will hasten the end of the death penalty in the United States.</p>

<p>Archbishop Thomas Wenski, of Miami, and chairman of the U.S. bishops’ Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, praised the decision,  saying, “... The use of the death penalty devalues human life and diminishes respect for human dignity. We bishops continue to say: We cannot teach killing is wrong by killing.”</p>

<p>The chair of the Pro-Life Activities committee, Boston Cardinal Seán O’Malley, also praised the court’s decision  to hear the case. “Society can protect itself in ways other than the use of the death penalty,” Cardinal O’Malley said. “We pray that the court’s review of these protocols will lead to the recognition that institutionalized practices of violence against any person erode reverence for the sanctity of every human life. Capital punishment must end.”</p>

<p>We, the editors of four Catholic journals — America , National Catholic Register , National Catholic Reporter  and Our Sunday Visitor  — urge the readers of our diverse publications and the whole U.S. Catholic community and all people of faith to stand with us and say, “Capital punishment must end.”</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in this country has fought against the death penalty for decades. Pope St. John Paul II amended the universal Catechism of the Catholic Church to include a de facto prohibition against capital punishment ( 2263-2267 ). Last year , Pope Francis called on all Catholics “to fight ... for the abolition of the death penalty.” The practice is abhorrent and unnecessary. It is also insanely expensive, as court battles soak up resources better deployed in preventing crime in the first place and working toward restorative justice for those who commit less heinous crimes.</p>

<p>Admirably, Florida has halted executions until the Supreme Court rules, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich has postponed all seven executions in the state scheduled for 2015 pending further study. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on the death penalty until he has received and reviewed a task force’s report on capital punishment, which he called “a flawed system ... ineffective, unjust and expensive.” Both governors also cited the growing number of death-row inmates who have been exonerated nationwide in recent years.</p>

<p>In a statement  thanking Wolf, Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said: “Turning away from capital punishment does not diminish our support for the families of murder victims. ... But killing the guilty does not honor the dead nor does it ennoble the living. When we take a guilty person’s life, we only add to the violence in an already violent culture, and we demean our own dignity in the process.”</p>

<p>Archbishop Chaput reminds us that when considering the death penalty we cannot forget that it is we, acting through our government, who are the moral agents in an execution. The prisoner has committed his crime and has answered for it in this life, just as he shall answer for it before God. But it is the government, acting in our name, that orders and perpetrates lethal injection. It is we who add to, instead of heal, the violence.</p>

<p>Advocates of the death penalty often claim that it brings closure to a victim’s family. But advocates who walk with the families of victims, like Mercy Sister Camille D’Arienzo, tell a different story.</p>

<p>“I think of mothers who attend our annual service for Families and Friends of Murder Victims,” a program the Mercy sisters have sponsored for 18 years. “Asked what they want for their children’s killers, no one asks for the death penalty,” she said. “Their reason: ‘I wouldn’t want another mother to suffer what I have suffered.’ Their hearts, though broken, are undivided in their humanity.”</p>

<p>The facts of the case in Oklahoma — which echo reports from Ohio and Arizona — were especially egregious. Last April, the drug protocol failed in the execution of Clayton Lockett. Lockett moaned in pain before authorities suspended the execution; he would die of a heart attack later that night. Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City said at the time , “The execution of Clayton Lockett really highlights the brutality of the death penalty, and I hope it leads us to consider whether we should adopt a moratorium on the death penalty or even abolish it altogether.”</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has agreed with Archbishop Coakley and will consider the issue. We join our bishops in hoping the court will reach the conclusion that it is time for our nation to embody its commitment to the right to life by abolishing the death penalty once and for all.</p>

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>
<p>An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.</p>

(Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN)</p>
<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>
<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you.

(Credit: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love. “I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead. Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.” “I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post. This is the Pennsylvania Driver’s License photo of Pittsburgh synagogue suspect Robert Bowers, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. (Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN) Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail. Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.” He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.” Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love. “Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.”', 3188, N' (Credit: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) ‘I Wanted Him to Feel Compassion’: Jewish Nurse Describes Treating Man Accused of Killing 11 at Pittsburgh Synagogue A makeshift memorial ...', N'‘I Wanted Him to Feel Compassion’: Jewish Nurse Describes Treating Man Accused of Killing 11 at Pittsburgh Synagogue', N'https://ktla.com/2018/11/04/i-wanted-him-to-feel-compassion-jewish-nurse-describes-treating-man-accused-of-killing-11-at-pittsburgh-synagogue/', N'ktla.com', N'"Null"', N'https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-1056830258.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200', 3500, 3500)

<p>For centuries most Americans have believed that ?the shot heard ?round the world? in 1775 from Concord, Massachusetts, heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history. Early observers of America such as G.W.F. Hegel, Edward Gibbon and Edmund Burke believed that, too. A new kind of republican citizen was rising, amid and against adherents of theocracy, divine-right monarchy, aristocracy and mercantilism. Republican citizens were quickening humanity?s stride toward horizons radiant with promises never before held and shared as widely as they were in America.</p>
                    
    
<p>The creation of the United States really was a Novus ordo seclorum, a New Order of the Ages, a society?s first self-aware, if fumbling and compromised, effort to live by the liberal expectation that autonomous individuals could govern themselves together without having to impose religious doctrines or mystical narratives of tribal blood or soil. With barely a decorous nod to The Creator, the founders of the American republic conferred on one another the right to have rights, a distinguished group of them constituting the others as ?We, the people.?</p>
<p>That revolutionary effort is not just in trouble now, or endangered, or under attack, or reinventing itself. It?s in prison, with no prospect of parole, and many Americans, including me, who wring our hands or wave our arms about this are actually among the jailers, or we?ve sleepwalked ourselves and others into the cage and have locked ourselves in. We haven?t yet understood the shots fired and heard ?round the world from 74 American schools, colleges and military bases since the Sandy Hook School massacre of December 2012.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>These shots haven?t been fired by embattled farmers at invading armies. They haven?t been fired by terrorists who?ve penetrated our surveillance and security systems. With few exceptions, they haven?t been fired by aggrieved non-white Americans. They?ve been fired mostly by young, white American citizens at other white citizens, and by American soldiers at other American soldiers, inside the very institutions where republican virtues and beliefs are nurtured and defended.</p>
<p>They?ve been fired from within a body politic so drained of candor and trust that, beneath our continuing lip-service to republican premises and practices, we?ve let a court conflate the free speech of flesh-and-blood citizens with the disembodied wealth of anonymous shareholders. And we?ve let lawmakers, bought or intimidated by gun peddlers and zealots, render us helpless against torrents of marketed fear and vengeance that are dissolving a distinctively American democratic ethos the literary historian? Daniel Aaron? characterized as ?ethical and pragmatic, disciplined and free.?</p>
<p>Many Americans are adapting to living with variants of force and fraud that erupt in road rage; lethal stampedes by shoppers on sale days; security precautions in their homes against the prospect of armed invasion; gladiatorialization and corruption in sports; nihilism in entertainment that fetishizes violence without context and sex without attachment ; the casino-like financing of utterly unproductive economic activities such as the entertainment I''ve just mentioned and the predatory lending that has tricked millions out of their homes; the commercial groping and goosing of private lives and public spaces, even in the marketing of ordinary consumer goods; and the huge, new prison industry that Americans have created to deter or punish broken, violent men, most of them non-white, only to find schools in even the whitest, ?safest? neighborhoods imprisoned by fear of white gunmen who?ve often been students themselves.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>Abroad, meanwhile, thousands more shots, fiendish and celebratory, are being fired into the corpses of American national-security and nation-building projects by terrorists and fanatics we were told had been decimated. These projects cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, limbs, homes and hopes, including those of American soldiers, contractors and idealists. Their sacrifices can?t justify retroactively what shouldn?t have been undertaken in the first place.</p>
<p>Stressed by all this republican derangement, millions are spending billions on palliatives, medications, addictions and even surveillance designed to protect them from themselves. All those vials, syringes, security systems and shootings reflect the insinuation of what Gibbon called ?a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire?? until Roman citizens ?no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.? Only a few late-Roman republicans, recalling their old freedoms, concluded, with Livy, that ?We have become too ill to bear our sickness or their cures.?</p>

And it still had a guiding aristocracy of sorts, but supposedly only "an aristocracy of talent and virtue," as Jefferson put it, and not one of blood and ill-gotten wealth.?True, too, certain lingering Puritan beliefs had nourished in the embattled farmers (and, even long before 1775, in some of the Puritans themselves) a conviction that resistance to tyranny is obedience to God. That injunction to defy worldly power sometimes in the name of a Higher Power legitimated individual conscience and autonomy right up through the nonviolent defiance of the best of the civil-rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. But the American emphasis on individual conscience and autonomy also gestated a liberal capitalist republic that has reduced individualism to market exchanges in ways that are now destroying both individuals and the society. A liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily certain public virtues and beliefs that neither the liberal state nor markets can nourish or defend. The liberal state isn?t supposed to judge between one way of life and another, after all; and markets reward you as a self-interested consumer and investor, not as a citizen who might put such interests aside at times to advance a greater good that self-interest alone can''t achieve. The moral silence and often bankruptcy of states and markets leaves citizen-leaders to be nourished and trained all the more intensively in institutions that stand somewhat apart from the state and markets. The Puritan founders of America?s oldest colleges understood this, but they expected that those colleges'' graduates would serve a theocratic state that would control markets and everything else.?We?re right to dismiss the Puritans? theocracy because it was repressive and hypocritical. But we''re wrong to have lost a side of its animating spirit that would have kept markets from controlling and devouring republican government and even our bodies and ourselves. Symptoms and scapegoats hide the disease Having miscarried republican self-discipline and conviction so badly, we find ourselves scrambling to monitor, measure and control the consequences, such as the proliferation of mental illness and the glorification and marketing of guns, as if these were causing our implosion. They aren?t. They?re symptoms, not causes -- reactions to widespread heartbreak at the breakdown of what Tocqueville called republican habits of the heart that we used to cultivate. Equally symptomatic, not causal, are self-avowedly ?deviant? and ?transgressive? gyrations by people who imagine that the sunset of civic-republican order heralds a liberating, Dionysian dawn. Sloughing off our bad old repressions, we?ve been swept up by the swift market currents that turn countercultures into over-the-counter cultures and promote a free-for-all that?s a free-for-none as citizens become customers chasing ?freedoms? for sale. Even our war-makers? and -mongers? grand strategies and the growing militarization of our domestic police forces are more symptomatic than causal of the public derangement that''s rising all around us. But turning the bearers of such frightening symptoms into our primary villains or scapegoats would only deepen our blindness to the disease, which is as old as the biblical worship of the Golden Calf and as new as Goldman Sachs. It runs deeper than anything that anyone but the Puritans and their Old Testament models tried to tackle. I''m not suggesting we can or should return to Puritanism! Anyone expecting to recover that faith and way of life is stumbling up dry streambeds toward wellsprings that have themselves run dry. But we do need wellsprings that could fortify us to take risks even more daunting than those taken by the embattled farmers. We''d somehow have to reconfigure or abandon empty comforts, escapes and protections that both free-market conservatives and readers of Salon are accustomed to buying and selling, sometimes against our own best hopes and convictions. Our cure would also require reweaving a fabric of public candor and comity strong enough to resist the rise of?ressentiment, a public psychopathology, once associated with the rise of fascism, in which insecurities, envy and hatreds that many have been nursing in private converge in scary public eruptions that diminish their participants even in seeming to make them big.?Ressentiment?s??little-big man? seeks easy targets for frustrations borne of exploitation by powers that he''s afraid to face and reckon with head-on. Blaming scapegoats warps his assessment of his hardships and options and drives him to wreak vengeance on them as soon as there are enough little-big men (and women, of course) to do so?en masse?under a Glenn Beck or a Sarah Palin. Whether?ressentiment?erupts in racist violence, sectarian fanaticism, anti-Communist witch hunts, totalitarian show trials, politically correct cultural revolutions or sadistic escapism, its most telling symptoms are paranoia and routinized bursts of hysteria. Under the ministrations of gifted demagogues, its grievances and pain assume a fleeting brilliance that soon collapses, tragi-comically or catastrophically, on its own cowardice and lies. Its targets often shift. The 9/11 attacks brought a reprieve of sorts to African-Americans, the republic?s most enduring scapegoats, when the burden of white censure pivoted toward Muslims. Louis Farrakhan?s Nation of Islam lost credibility, but so did whites such as the neoconservative Daniel Pipes, who kept on insisting years after 9/11 that the first black president was a Muslim and a friend of terrorists. The slipperiness of scapegoating became clear to me in 1993, as I?wrote?about a deranged black gunman, Colin Ferguson, who?d opened fire in a Long Island Rail Road car, killing six passengers. Even while holding him responsible, I saw him bearing symptoms far more widespread than his private demons. Noting Ferguson?s enthusiasm for a politics of rage, paranoia and death threats then prominent on a black radio station and in demagogic street politics, I warned that even deranged loners are sometimes better attuned to our subconscious hatreds and fears than we care to admit.?That was true, too, of?Jared Loughner,?the white paranoid-schizophrenic and anti-government fantasist who killed a U.S. District Court judge and six other people while trying to kill but severely wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 13 others in 2011. While apocalyptic religious and racist ranting can provoke emotionally disturbed people, so can journalism and entertainment that massage hatreds too diffuse to be called racist, religious or ideological. Some school shooters nursed the depictions of violence and lust that are?pumped incessantly?into young Americans? horizons with the help of new technologies and investment strategies that ride reckless misreadings of the First Amendment.?This hasn?t been done with malevolent intent as often as it?s been done in a kind of civic mindlessness by media corporations incentivized and indeed forced by market pressures to bypass our brains and hearts on the way to our lower viscera and wallets by exaggerating fears of armed home invasion, government takeover and vengeful victory by gunplay. The invisible disease Even though relatively few young Americans follow these siren songs into acts of destruction, the public fetishizing of sex and violence without context or caring dampens many others? faith in society during their formative years. You don?t need to know a lot of developmental psychology or anthropology to know that children crave culturally coherent tests of prowess and loyalty in symbolic rites of passage that ratify their communal belonging. When such rites and symbols fail, some flail about, seeking order in private delusions, Dartmouth College fraternities and public orchestrations of?ressentiment. In 1775, most American communities still filtered such basic generational and human needs through traditions that encompassed kinship bonds and seasonal rhythms. In "Common Sense," Thomas Paine could urge readers to take their recent experiences of monarchy ?to the touchstones of nature? and decide whether they would abide the empire''s abuses.?Today, those "touchstones of nature" -- and with them, republican convictions about selfhood and society -- have been torn up by runaway engines and developments in technology, communications and even intimate biology that would terrify Paine, Adam Smith and John Locke, not to mention those who fired the first shot at Concord. This time, we''re all in bed with the enemy. In "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" 40 years ago, Daniel Bell -- no anti-capitalist, but prophetic enough about the worship of Golden Calves -- argued that free markets no longer make free men because "economic liberalism has become? corporate oligopoly, and, in the pursuit of private wants, a hedonism that is destructive of social needs." He warned that consumer capitalism displaces the needs that the early republic filtered through nature?s rhythms and kinship traditions. It displaces those needs with ginned-up ?wants? that ?by their nature, are unlimited and insatiable?. [T]he rational calculation of efficiency and return? displace ?the principle of the public household," strip-mining and selling off fragments of cultural narratives. Without civic wellsprings and narratives deep and compelling enough to strengthen a society?s adhesives and disciplines in the hearts of its young, neither free-market conservatives nor world-is-flat neoliberal cosmopolitans can reconcile their professed commitments to ordered, republican liberty with their knee-jerk obedience to riptides of destructive investment that are dissolving republican virtue and sovereignty before our eyes. No wonder we?re losing our vision, in both senses of the word: Our foreign-policy savants across the ideological spectrum were too blind to see that the Soviet Union was so much weaker than American Cold War propaganda and hysteria insisted that it imploded in 1989. The fabled "missile gap" that John F. Kennedy ran on in 1960 was as imaginary as Saddam Hussein''s WMD, but anyone who tried telling either of those truths was charged with a ?failure of nerve? or worse by the blind warmongers in our midst. Our business press was too blind to see that a tsunami of predatory lending would wreck the national economy and throw millions from their homes. Our market-addled congressional committees and blue-ribbon commissions on national intelligence couldn?t discover, until Edward Snowden revealed it, that public surveillance had taken on an all-devouring life of its own. Neoconservative and Vulcan conservative advocates of using American military force to spread democracy abroad couldn?t see that their strategy was doomed because democracy isn''t woven that way and because it was destroying democracy at home in ways that, if unchecked, will destroy the republic whose strengths they''ve so badly misconstrued and betrayed. Our consumer society, addicted to cheap comforts and quick fixes, can''t see its own Orwellian ensnarement by commercial censors, and it couldn?t take Al Gore?s "Inconvenient Truth? about global warming seriously enough to offset the onrushing damage with the serious sacrifices we have yet to make. Our gilded political consultants, pollsters and campaign donors were too blind to see the boiling undercurrents that have swept away House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Nor can they see that Cantor?s political demise presages an inflammation of?ressentiment?so wild that the coming, specious, ?Who Lost Iraq?? debate will be accompanied by the shot that some military veteran who feels betrayed will fire at a politician who?s been left holding the empty bag of our civic-republican hopes. So we are flying almost totally blind, punched bloody by a Hand that we keep insisting is Invisible. We can see only the sickness of the gunmen and of the proliferation of their guns. Treatment of those symptoms is urgently needed, but it will be insufficient to curb the wrecking ball that global capitalism has become on our willfully blind watch, and triage won''t renew the civic fabric. Exemplary defiance has its place Whenever republican candor and courage have seemed about to succumb like this to tribal and theocratic delusions or to force and fraud in the past, some citizens have roused others to fend off threats to republican premises and practices: In 1776 a young schoolteacher named Nathan Hale was caught trying to track and expose the military and intelligence operations of the only established, legitimate government of his time. But just before his hanging he said, ?I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country? and became an incarnation of a nascent republic. Hale''s dignity in adversity, unfathomable to many of us these days, anticipated that of Martin Luther King Jr. and the black churchgoers who walked unarmed and trembling toward armed men and dogs with nothing but their faith and their long-shot strategy to delegitimate the seemingly impregnable segregationist establishment of their time by appealing to republican principles and an American civil religion whose theology was as vague as that of the founders. Hale?s dignity also anticipated that of three Yale seniors I came upon one wintry morning in 1968 as they gave university chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. their military draft cards to announce their resistance to the U.S. government on behalf of the American republic. ?The government says we?re criminals, but we say the government is criminal for waging this war,? said one of the seniors, struggling to find his voice. For all we knew, these guys were about to be arrested on the spot, and some of us felt arrested morally by their example because they were ready to pay the penalty of law in order to affirm their commitment to honest law itself. Coffin, who held to a Calvinist theology that, like King?s, saw resistance to tyranny as obedience to God, was present to bless a courage that few national-security state conservatives understand, in the idiom of an American civil religion few neoliberals and postmodern leftists understand. When he quoted Dylan Thomas? ?Do not go gentle into that good night; rage, rage, against the dying of the light,? that civil religion seemed to awaken briefly and to walk and talk again, re-moralizing the state and the law, and the silent, wild confusion I was feeling gave way to something like awe. (I described this experience?in The Washington Monthly in 2000, during the protracted ?election? of George W. Bush.) Hale?s courage also anticipated Edward Snowden?s. Both young men may have been impetuous and otherwise flawed in some respects, but they showed that resistance to corrupted power requires not only prowess, means, and will, but an elusive, republican sensibility that?s cultivated in civil society and confirmed in little daily interactions long before it emerges in demonstrations of civic courage that startle and move other citizens. With a wonderment somewhat like Hegel?s, the German political philosopher J?rgen Habermas marveled at this ?constitutional patriotism? in American citizens who possessed what Gibbon described as ?that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honor, the presence of danger, and the habit of command.? When I tell young millennials these stories, though, many of them listen pretty much as they would to tales about knights in shining armor, long ago and far away. Much closer to them are the school shootings and internet mayhem that make brave citizenship seem archaic, implausible and irrelevant to self-discovery and social change. Yet republican expectations do have ways of resurfacing whenever ?We, the people? begin to imagine what our lives would be like, singly and together, if we had to live without them. Not everyone can be seduced or intimidated away from them. Still, so many Americans are generations removed from any easily recoverable religious or ethno-racial identity or other adhesive that we have to ask: Where are the touchstones or narratives strong enough renew public virtues and beliefs that neither markets nor the liberal state do much to nourish or defend? Nourishing a new liberal order The question should prompt a quest for a political culture that isn?t too commercial and vapid and that isn''t held together only by demagoguery and delusion. No reconfiguration of today?s capitalism will be possible without something better than that. Yet no think tank, legislature or foundation can carry that quest or that reconfiguration to a just conclusion. Nor can an Occupy Wall Street that isn?t grounded in something deeper than its own noble effort to?be?the change it wants us all to make. Nor can our ?illness? be cured by champions of a new foreign-policy??realism? such as Robert Kagan, who?urge us to face the inevitable challenges?of a world where only willpower and force can sustain the liberal order that many Americans take for granted. That?s right as far as it goes,?but it begs the question of where willpower comes from and what, within the liberal order itself, is sapping that willpower. Quoting Michael Ignatieff, Kagan speculates candidly that liberal civilization itself ?runs deeply against the human grain and is achieved and sustained only by the most unremitting struggle against human nature.? Perhaps, Kagan adds, ?this fragile democratic garden requires the protection of a liberal world order, with constant feeding, watering, weeding, and the fencing off of an ever-encroaching jungle.? But he can?t seem to face the challenge posed by the new shots heard ?round the world from America: The jungle and its encroachments begin not only abroad but within our own garden. What seems our greatest weakness could be one of our greatest strengths, although it, too, won''t be enough: Even 150 years after the founding, the philosopher George Santayana?wrote?that Americans still heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history precisely because they?d ?all been uprooted from their several soils and ancestries and plunged together into one vortex, whirling irresistible in a space otherwise quite empty. To be an American is of itself almost a moral condition, an education and a career?.? Although there?s plenty to regret and respect in the traditions we?ve lost, there?s no turning back from the ?moral condition? and ?career? we face as citizens. We have no choice but to keep faith with the republic and one another. If Americans have a manifest destiny now, it?s to lead in weaving a new republican fabric that markets can serve but not subvert. In 2008, Barack Obama seemed to incarnate so brilliantly the promise of weaving our diversity into a new republican discipline -- he even invoked Puritan and biblical wellsprings in some of his speeches -- that many people ?round the world considered him a prophet who would satisfy their hunger for new narratives. Probably no national political leader ever can do that. The narratives the world needs now will have to come from other prophets and leaders yet unsung. I do think that Americans will be strong among them, if only because we?ve had so much experience generating that hunger by generating the civic-republican-capitalist effort that has failed.', 28851, N'no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the ...', N'Our republic is in crisis — and it’s killing us.

PointdeBascule in Montreal answers the imam’s request by producing not one, but TWO Islamic texts stating that a father who kills his child must NOT be subject to punishment ( “retaliation” ).</p>

 
<p>The first text is “Umdat al-Saliq”  or “Reliance of the Traveller” , a manual of Islamic law certified in 1991 as a reliable guide to Sunni Islam by Cairo’s renowned al-Azhar University, the most prestigious and authoritative institute of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence in the world. This manual, composed in the 14 th  century,states that punishment or “retaliation is obligatory against anyone who kills a human being purely intentionally and without right”  EXCEPT when “a father or mother (or their fathers or mothers)”  kills their “ offspring, or offspring’s offspring”  (section o1.1-2). In other words, a parent who murders his/her child for the sake of honour, is not penalized under Islamic law or Shariah.</p><p>The Umdat al-Saliq was also endorsed by the Muslim Brotherhood-linked International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) in the United States. In the opening pages, the IIIT writes “there is no doubt that this translation is a valuable and important work, whether as a textbook for teaching Islamic jurisprudence to English speakers, or as a legal reference for use by scholars, educated laymen, and students in this language.”  The Umdat al-Saliq is by no means an irrelevant or outdated document, and its  r ulings, including those on the subject of retaliation for murder, are legally binding and not subject for debate.</p><p>Another text that supports the immunity for parents who kill their children was written by the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1902-1989), an authority of Shiite Islam who led the Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979. In his book “Resaleh Towzih Al-Massael”  or “A Clarification of Questions”  published in 1961, Khomeini specifies under “conditions of retaliation”  (section 2.3 of Appendix II) that there is no penalty for a father who kills his child, the father will simply not be punished under Islamic law. A killer is punished if: “The slayer is not the father of the slain, nor the parental grandfather (apparently)” .</p><p>Both aforementioned Sunni and Shiite texts support the practice of honour killing in Islam, contrary to Hashmi’s claim, and serve as authentic and authoritative sources of Islamic law to this day. The Shafia killings did not occur in a vacuum, despite Hashmi’s attempts to convince us otherwise. Furthermore, Hashmi is not alone in his attempt to assure us that honour killings have nothing to do with Islam. Another imam, Samy Metwally of the Ottawa Mosque and a graduate of al-Azhar University, also attempts to distance Islam from the horror of the Shafia honour killings. He says “what’s called honour killing is not part of Islamic teaching or tradition, and in fact there is no honour in this killing at all.”</p><p>If honour killing is alien to Islam, then why are the penalties, if any, for men who kill women in honour-killings, so lenient in Muslim countries? And why are honour killings more prevalent in the Muslim world and amongst Muslim communities than in the West?

Prosecutor Mohammed al-Tarawneh said the man turned himself into police and has been charged with murder. The 28-year-old married woman was five months pregnant and stabbed repeatedly in the face, neck, abdomen and back as well as being hacked up with a meat cleaver, according to government pathologist Awad al-Tarawneh. Police familiar with the case said the woman had moved back in with her family after an argument with her husband six months earlier. The brother believed that she had then started seeing other men. The names of those involved have not been released. The incident, the ninth such case this year and the second this month, took place in the village of Basira, in the conservative Bedouin heartland of southern Jordan. Strict tribal and religious values are enforced in these villages, including the belief that women carry the family''s honor. Around two dozen women are killed each year in these conservative areas of Jordan by male relatives who typically accuse them of besmirching the family honor through adultery or having sex outside of marriage. International human rights organisations have condemned honor killings in Jordan and appealed to King Abdullah II to put an end to the practice. But attempts to introduce harsher sentences have been blocked in Jordan''s parliament, where the predominantly conservative Bedouin lawmakers argue that tougher penalties would lead to adultery.

The society condemned the killing of the youth," said representatives of the Parents Association.

<br />?We understand the agony of Pranay''s family. They can install his statue in their own premises so that they can feel his presence always. A statue in the public place is not acceptable.

<br />
<br />The police, revenue, municipal, and roads and buildings departments are in principle not ready to accord permission, on the grounds that it might lead to conflicts in the future.

<br />The Roads and Buildings department has conveyed its objection to the police, on grounds that statue would disturb the design of the road.
<br />
<br />On the contrary, Dalit organisations, which have shouldered the responsibility of fulfilling Amrutha?s desire, are busy making arrangements for erecting the statue.
<br />
<br />Social media is also divided on the issue. There are campaigns for and against the idea of setting up Pranay''s statue.
<br />
<br />Those opposing the statue are asking, ?What would the statue tell the next generation? To fall in love when in high school??.

    <p>Murder is the most serious of all violent crimes, and needs a determined criminal justice response. If there are circumstances in which a killing might be seen as wholly or partly excusable, then this is of interest to all citizens - particularly if these circumstances weigh unevenly against a specific social group. </p>

<p>Provocation is a defence that signals reduced culpability for an intentional killing by replacing a murder conviction with one of manslaughter. Historically it differentiated killings worthy of the death penalty from less heinous killings committed ?in the heat of passion? without premeditation. </p>

<p>This was linked to a tradition of male social honour, a breach of which tended to provoke an angry response. Behaviour seen by criminal courts in the past as an affront to male honour included insults arising from drunken fights or a wife?s adultery. Unfortunately, the latter situation is still seen by some, such as Christian lobby group FamilyVoice Australia , to be an acceptable defence to murder today. The perpetuation of such views is partly the reason why provocation has been subject to so much criticism and why some jurisdictions have abolished provocation.</p>

<p>An affront to male honour which in recent decades has been used to argue a case of provocation is the so-called ?homosexual advance defence? (HAD), sometimes incorrectly referred to as the ?gay panic? defence (which is actually a failed US version of the defence strategy). </p>

<p>Since the 1990s, gay and lesbian activists have expressed serious concerns about homicide cases in which an accused male killer or killers pleads provocation on the basis of an alleged unwanted sexual advance from the victim who was known or assumed to be homosexual. </p>

<p>The argument is that a man who is the subject of an unwanted sexual pass by another man finds this so provoking that he loses self-control and kills. According to the law, if an ?ordinary? person could have reacted the way that the offender did by losing their self-control in the face of victim?s behaviour, then the charge of murder will be reduced to manslaughter. </p>

<p>This strategy relies on negative courtroom depictions of the homosexual victim. The logic is that the perpetrator is a ?regular? masculine man or youth whose goodwill is pushed to the limit by being propositioned or even sexually touched by a homosexual ?nuisance?. </p>

<p>The use of this defence strategy in the NSW case of Green v The Queen  in the 1990s reached all the way to the most senior judges in the land. A majority ruling by the Australian High Court favourably viewed the accused killer?s appeal against a murder conviction and paved the way for his eventual securing of a much lighter sentence for manslaughter. </p>

<p>The Green case was subject to much criticism because the court allowed claims of a homosexual advance to substantiate a claim of provocation. In reaching this decision the majority of these judges did not take the opportunity to rule that no ordinary person could be provoked to kill by a non-violent sexual pass. In fact, several comments were made which suggested that such extreme violence may often be expected. </p>

<p>The High Court result in Green mobilised gay and lesbian lobbyists nationwide. It spurred an official Attorney-General?s Working Party Inquiry  in NSW which in 1998 recommended that a non-violent sexual advance should be barred from forming the basis of a provocation defence.  Nothing came of those recommendations. </p>

<p>More general feminist opposition to provocation because of the way in which it has traditionally privileged male violence and not worked for females has to an extent been more successful and led to provocation being abolished in Victoria , Tasmania  and Western Australia . </p>

<p>Other jurisdictions  have retained the defence of provocation but amended it with the aim of removing its more problematic aspects. For example, amendments in the ACT and Northern Territory bar the use of provocation on the basis of a non-violent sexual advance. Queensland also retains provocation but bars the defence of provocation in response to the ending or changing of a domestic relationship. Parallel to this reduction in the scope of provocation Queensland has also introduced a specific defence of killing for preservation in an abusive domestic relationship .   </p>

<p>The result of these changes is that NSW and Queensland are the only jurisdictions that still retain provocation and have no legislative bar against provocation claims based on a sexual advance (in South Australia provocation is a common law defence and is not found in statute). Two recent cases  in Queensland in which provocation was used successfully to reduce charges from murder to manslaughter have once again ignited concern about allowing the defence on the basis of sexual advance. </p>

<p>The ensuing campaign for change led to the creation of a working party in 2011 to examine the operation of the homosexual advance defence and a government pledge to amend the Queensland Criminal Code to, in the words of the former Attorney-General Paul Lucas :</p>

 
<p>make it crystal clear that someone making a pass at someone is not grounds for a partial defence and by no means an excuse for horribly violent acts. </p>
 

<p>But a change in government means there is now no commitment for reform in Queensland, as stated by the current Attorney-General, Jarrod Bleijie .</p>

<p>Meanwhile, things might be about to change in NSW. In the fifteen years since the Attorney-General?s Working Party recommended changes to the law, successive governments have reneged on their promises of reform or ignored this issue. Now, however, a select committee  has been established to inquire into provocation in NSW, and is currently accepting submissions.</p>

<p>This review was sparked by the case of Chamanjot Singh , who was sentenced to six years imprisonment after being found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder of his wife on the basis that he had been provoked by verbal abuse. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether NSW will join Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia in abolishing provocation outright, or whether it will make amendments to remove more controversial elements such as its use in HAD claims. </p>

<p>What sort of signals about male interaction and violence does the legal status of the homosexual advance defence send to men and boys? If the answer to this question suggests physical and even fatal violence as the acceptable response, rather than a simple declaration of non-interest, then we should consider why our society would not tolerate a similar violent reaction from women who are subjected to routine unwanted overtures from men. </p>

<p>The ongoing failure to scrap the homosexual advance defence and the partial excuse it provides to certain forms of male violence is an embarrassment and an injustice for the citizens of Queensland and NSW. </p>

<p>The politicians of NSW now have the chance to change this and we should all hope they do not fail a second time.  </p>

According to Israeli authorities, Karra’s motive was based on his “ vehement opposition ” to her relationship with her Muslim boyfriend and her intentions to become a Muslim. </p><p>Henriette’s boyfriend, who remains unidentified, was in prison at the time and due to be released by the end of that week. Henriette reportedly said she was planning on converting to Islam the day her boyfriend was freed. Later that day, Henriette was found dead in her parents’ kitchen with multiple stab wounds to her neck.</p><p></p><p>Darakshan Raja, the founder of the Muslim American Women’s Policy Forum, noted a double standard in the media coverage on Henriette’s death. She said that if Karra were Muslim and killed Henriette for wanting to convert to Christianity and falling in love with her Christian boyfriend, the alleged murder would be described as an “honor killing.”</p><p>An honor killing is the murder of a relative, particularly a girl or woman, who is perceived as bringing dishonor to the family. According to the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network , an estimated 5,000 honor killings happen worldwide each year. </p><p>“If it had been a Muslim father, then [the murder] would further be weaponized to push the framing that Muslim men are controlling, abusive and violent,” Raja said in an email.</p><p>Raja said “honor killing” is not the appropriate term for these killings and that it has been used as a moniker for domestic violence.</p><p>“Rather than centering the individual killed and positioning it as gender-based violence, because unfortunately many women — irrespective of faith and race — are murdered at the hands of men they know,” she said. “This is a universal issue and isn’t specific to any one community.”</p>An alleged history of domestic violence in Henriette’s family<p>Two weeks before her death, Henriette reportedly ran away from home after her family allegedly beat her and told her to break up with her Muslim boyfriend, Haaretz  reported. She stayed with a friend, then lived with her boyfriend’s mother for the time being. According to Newsweek , the family continued to make threats toward Henriette and her boyfriend’s mother as an attempt to bring her back home.</p><p>Henriette made several calls to the police to report incidents of violence by her parents, Newsweek  reported. On June 11, Israeli police and social services held a meeting with the family. Henriette wanted to live in her own apartment, but after the meeting, she was told she had to return home. </p><p>Honor killing cases have been used as bait to round up support for anti-Muslim and xenophobic policies. The most notable example of this is President Donald Trump citing the killing of Pakistani celebrity Qandeel Baloch  to justify his ban against Muslims entering the country.

Sami Karra allegedly killed his daughter, Henriette, on June 13, one day after her high school graduation. According to Israeli authorities, Karra’s motive was based on his “vehement opposition” to her relationship with her Muslim boyfriend and her intentions to become a Muslim. Henriette’s boyfriend, who remains unidentified, was in prison at the time and due to be released by the end of that week. Henriette reportedly said she was planning on converting to Islam the day her boyfriend was freed. Later that day, Henriette was found dead in her parents’ kitchen with multiple stab wounds to her neck. Darakshan Raja, the founder of the Muslim American Women’s Policy Forum, noted a double standard in the media coverage on Henriette’s death. She said that if Karra were Muslim and killed Henriette for wanting to convert to Christianity and falling in love with her Christian boyfriend, the alleged murder would be described as an “honor killing.” An honor killing is the murder of a relative, particularly a girl or woman, who is perceived as bringing dishonor to the family. According to the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network, an estimated 5,000 honor killings happen worldwide each year. “If it had been a Muslim father, then [the murder] would further be weaponized to push the framing that Muslim men are controlling, abusive and violent,” Raja said in an email. Raja said “honor killing” is not the appropriate term for these killings and that it has been used as a moniker for domestic violence. “Rather than centering the individual killed and positioning it as gender-based violence, because unfortunately many women — irrespective of faith and race — are murdered at the hands of men they know,” she said. “This is a universal issue and isn’t specific to any one community.” An alleged history of domestic violence in Henriette’s family Two weeks before her death, Henriette reportedly ran away from home after her family allegedly beat her and told her to break up with her Muslim boyfriend, Haaretz reported. She stayed with a friend, then lived with her boyfriend’s mother for the time being. According to Newsweek, the family continued to make threats toward Henriette and her boyfriend’s mother as an attempt to bring her back home. Henriette made several calls to the police to report incidents of violence by her parents, Newsweek reported. On June 11, Israeli police and social services held a meeting with the family. Henriette wanted to live in her own apartment, but after the meeting, she was told she had to return home. Honor killing cases have been used as bait to round up support for anti-Muslim and xenophobic policies. The most notable example of this is President Donald Trump citing the killing of Pakistani celebrity Qandeel Baloch to justify his ban against Muslims entering the country. Other high profile examples are Samia Sarwar, Samaira Nazir and Ghazala Khan. Honor killings are often depicted as a part of practicing Islam.

<p>IN an article titled: ?Illegality of death penalty?, eminent Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana, made authoritative legal submissions in reaction to the reported ?directive?, of Nigeria?s President Goodluck Jonathan, which called on governors to sign death warrants of condemned persons. The respected human rights advocate?s views were published in The PUNCH of Monday, July 1, this year. His views were also reported in several other print and electronic media- including online platforms.</p>
<p>This piece identifies some assumptions that underpinned the respectable Advocate?s submissions. Accordingly, it contends, with utmost respect, that the resulting arguments proceeded from a misapprehension of the stark position of the Nigerian Constitution on the legality of the death penalty. The said article also misconceived the proper context of the President?s alleged ?directive?.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we argue for the legality of the death penalty and call for deeper circumspection in the deployment of rhetoric advocating its hasty and merely imitative abolition in Nigeria. Such circumspection is highly imperative, particularly in proven cases of premeditated, first degree and gruesome murders.</p>
<p>As mentioned, and in my view, the assumptions that seem to underpin the arguments and conclusions as contained in the respectable Senior Advocate?s piece include: (a) that the death penalty is illegal in Nigeria (and this assumption is apparent from the article?s title- i.e ?Illegality of Death Penalty?), (b.) that the President has ?directed? the execution of all death row inmates across Nigeria without regard to their yet-to-be exhausted Appeal processes pending against their convictions, (c.) that Nigeria is bound to honour and enforce the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 62/149 of 2007 purporting to place a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty in member states, (d.) that ?inordinate? delays in the execution of death row inmates amounts to dehumanization and thus, robs the State of the powers to carry out such executions, etc.</p>
<p>In the first place, the foundation for the legality of the death penalty in Nigeria is as provided under Section 33(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). For clarity, that Section provides that; ?Every person has a right to life, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life, save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria?. Clearly therefore, while the inalienability of the right to life is unambiguously emphasized by the Constitution, a legitimate ground for derogation is provided for in the same Constitution. Accordingly, when Statutes prescribe the death penalty for certain classes of crimes and so long as such Statutes derive their legitimacy from, and are not inconsistent with the Constitution, they are legally valid and enforceable. However, the ethical and jurisprudential questions, on what crimes should or should not attract the death penalty, are a fundamentally different matter altogether, and same is mentioned later in this piece. What must be continually noted is that the constitutional validity of the death penalty in Nigeria has been severally affirmed by the superior Courts up to the Supreme Court. It is common knowledge that the Supreme Court in particular have severally, either affirmed or quashed death sentences imposed by lower Courts, in several cases. Indeed, to this day, neither the Supreme Court nor the Constitution have declared the death penalty as being unconstitutional, and to that extent, it cannot be validly described as illegal in Nigeria.</p>
<p>As for the President?s alleged ?directive?, there is no thoroughly objective interpretation of the President?s alleged words, as widely reported in the media, that will definitively conclude that those words amounted to an order that death row convicts be denied of their rights to exhaustive and conclusive appeals- or even clemency, in deserving cases. The President?s alleged direct words, as even quoted in the piece under review, were that, ?in the case of capital punishment, the governors will sign. Even governors find it difficult to sign. I have been telling the governors that they must sign because that is the law?. Clearly, these words demonstrated an appreciation by the President that the death penalty cannot be pronounced and executed, except in accordance with the Law. And what is the Law if not as stated in the quoted Section 33(1) of the Constitution, and other Laws validly deriving legitimacy from the said Constitution, including extant legal principles relating to rights of exhaustive appeal, etc? Of course, the Law mentioned by Mr. President must also include the decided Nigerian authorities cited in the Learned Silk?s submissions under review, including Nasiru Bello v. Attorney-General of Oyo State (1986) 5 NWLR (pt. 45) 828, (1986) 2 N.S.C.C 1257, where the Supreme Court reiterated the pre-conditions that must mandatorily precede a valid execution of a convicted prisoner. The Supreme Court said, and no one can reasonably disagree, that, ?the execution of a convicted prisoner is the last act, in a series of acts beginning from his arrest; his trial and conviction, his appeals, and even after the appeals, the Governor of a State still has to consider the Report of the trial judge sent pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Law and finally, the report of the Committee for the Prerogative of Mercy. It is after all these have been exhausted that the Appellant goes under the hangman?s noose or (as in the instant case) faces the firing squad.? So, it is not in dispute that the stated pre-conditions must be thoroughly in place before any governor can even contemplate signing a death warrant. Clearly, the President?s statement does not contradict this legally valid procedure, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, making justification for the rhetoric against it difficult to locate. If anything, the President?s needlessly criticised statement affirmed commitment to the rule of Law by usage of the phrase, ?it is the law?. It means governors should sign death warrants in accordance, but never in violation or avoidance of the sweet or if you wish, ?bitter? dictates of the law. The admonition to follow the law cannot be objectively construed as an invitation to arbitrariness.</p>
<p>Flowing from the above, the cases of Nemi v. Attorney-General of Lagos State (1996) 6 NWLR 42 @55, wherein the Court of Appeal held that; ?a convict on death row is entitled to challenge torture, inhuman or degrading treatment arising from a prolonged delay in executing him? and Ogugu v. The State (1994) 9 NWLR (pt. 366) 1 @ 47, where the Supreme Court held that; ?The executive and judicial authorities must accept responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence, allowing reasonable time to appeal and consideration of reprieve?; rather than diminish, actually strengthen Mr. President?s widely reported view. This is because by ?directing? Governors to sign death warrants in accordance with the Law (of course after appeals have been exhausted), the President has merely, but very rightly, nudged State Governors to their constitutional responsibilities to prevent a situation where convicts are subjected to ?torture, inhuman or degrading treatment arising from a prolonged delay in executing them?. Indeed, the President?s ?directive?, having not been shown to be a call for arbitrariness, is in line with the Learned Senior Advocate?s submission that, ?it is indisputable that the execution of a condemned person ought to be carried out as swiftly as possible after sentence of death has been passed and confirmed by the Governor?. And without much ado, that appears to be the simple point the President was also making.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>The case of Kigula & Others v. The Attorney-General (2005) AHRLR 197 (up cc 2005) page 197 at 221, where the Supreme Court of Uganda directed the respondent to commute death sentences passed on the appellants to life imprisonment on the ground that ?the inordinate delay in carrying out the death sentence after it has been confirmed by the highest appellate court is inconsistent with articles 24 and 44(1) of the Constitution?, is absolutely not binding on any Court in Nigeria. At best, it can only be cited for persuasive and academic effect as our Courts will have to determine the appropriateness of such jurisprudence, in the peculiar case of Nigeria where citizens fall daily to gruesome crimes in an atmosphere of mendacious and arrogant impunity. The unreported decision in James Ajulu & Ors. v. Attorney-General of Lagos State, Suit No: ID/76M/2008, also does not support any inference that the death penalty is illegal. What it raises is the question of the methods and the timing for the carrying out of such executions. But of course, it is desirable to await the Supreme Court?s definitive pronouncement on all the many issues being weaved around the blanket death penalt', 9997, N'IN an article titled: ?Illegality of death penalty?, eminent Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana, made authoritative legal submissions in reaction to the reported ?directive?, of Nigeria?s President Goodluck Jonathan, which called on governors to sign death warrants of condemned persons.

For clarity, that Section provides that; ?Every person has a right to life, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life, save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria?. Clearly therefore, while the inalienability of the right to life is unambiguously emphasized by the Constitution, a legitimate ground for derogation is provided for in the same Constitution. Accordingly, when Statutes prescribe the death penalty for certain classes of crimes and so long as such Statutes derive their legitimacy from, and are not inconsistent with the Constitution, they are legally valid and enforceable. However, the ethical and jurisprudential questions, on what crimes should or should not attract the death penalty, are a fundamentally different matter altogether, and same is mentioned later in this piece. What must be continually noted is that the constitutional validity of the death penalty in Nigeria has been severally affirmed by the superior Courts up to the Supreme Court. It is common knowledge that the Supreme Court in particular have severally, either affirmed or quashed death sentences imposed by lower Courts, in several cases. Indeed, to this day, neither the Supreme Court nor the Constitution have declared the death penalty as being unconstitutional, and to that extent, it cannot be validly described as illegal in Nigeria. As for the President?s alleged ?directive?, there is no thoroughly objective interpretation of the President?s alleged words, as widely reported in the media, that will definitively conclude that those words amounted to an order that death row convicts be denied of their rights to exhaustive and conclusive appeals- or even clemency, in deserving cases. The President?s alleged direct words, as even quoted in the piece under review, were that, ?in the case of capital punishment, the governors will sign. Even governors find it difficult to sign. I have been telling the governors that they must sign because that is the law?. Clearly, these words demonstrated an appreciation by the President that the death penalty cannot be pronounced and executed, except in accordance with the Law. And what is the Law if not as stated in the quoted Section 33(1) of the Constitution, and other Laws validly deriving legitimacy from the said Constitution, including extant legal principles relating to rights of exhaustive appeal, etc? Of course, the Law mentioned by Mr. President must also include the decided Nigerian authorities cited in the Learned Silk?s submissions under review, including Nasiru Bello v. Attorney-General of Oyo State (1986) 5 NWLR (pt. 45) 828, (1986) 2 N.S.C.C 1257, where the Supreme Court reiterated the pre-conditions that must mandatorily precede a valid execution of a convicted prisoner. The Supreme Court said, and no one can reasonably disagree, that, ?the execution of a convicted prisoner is the last act, in a series of acts beginning from his arrest; his trial and conviction, his appeals, and even after the appeals, the Governor of a State still has to consider the Report of the trial judge sent pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Law and finally, the report of the Committee for the Prerogative of Mercy. It is after all these have been exhausted that the Appellant goes under the hangman?s noose or (as in the instant case) faces the firing squad.? So, it is not in dispute that the stated pre-conditions must be thoroughly in place before any governor can even contemplate signing a death warrant. Clearly, the President?s statement does not contradict this legally valid procedure, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, making justification for the rhetoric against it difficult to locate. If anything, the President?s needlessly criticised statement affirmed commitment to the rule of Law by usage of the phrase, ?it is the law?. It means governors should sign death warrants in accordance, but never in violation or avoidance of the sweet or if you wish, ?bitter? dictates of the law. The admonition to follow the law cannot be objectively construed as an invitation to arbitrariness. Flowing from the above, the cases of Nemi v. Attorney-General of Lagos State (1996) 6 NWLR 42 @55, wherein the Court of Appeal held that; ?a convict on death row is entitled to challenge torture, inhuman or degrading treatment arising from a prolonged delay in executing him? and Ogugu v. The State (1994) 9 NWLR (pt. 366) 1 @ 47, where the Supreme Court held that; ?The executive and judicial authorities must accept responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence, allowing reasonable time to appeal and consideration of reprieve?; rather than diminish, actually strengthen Mr. President?s widely reported view. This is because by ?directing? Governors to sign death warrants in accordance with the Law (of course after appeals have been exhausted), the President has merely, but very rightly, nudged State Governors to their constitutional responsibilities to prevent a situation where convicts are subjected to ?torture, inhuman or degrading treatment arising from a prolonged delay in executing them?. Indeed, the President?s ?directive?, having not been shown to be a call for arbitrariness, is in line with the Learned Senior Advocate?s submission that, ?it is indisputable that the execution of a condemned person ought to be carried out as swiftly as possible after sentence of death has been passed and confirmed by the Governor?. And without much ado, that appears to be the simple point the President was also making. The case of Kigula & Others v. The Attorney-General (2005) AHRLR 197 (up cc 2005) page 197 at 221, where the Supreme Court of Uganda directed the respondent to commute death sentences passed on the appellants to life imprisonment on the ground that ?the inordinate delay in carrying out the death sentence after it has been confirmed by the highest appellate court is inconsistent with articles 24 and 44(1) of the Constitution?, is absolutely not binding on any Court in Nigeria. At best, it can only be cited for persuasive and academic effect as our Courts will have to determine the appropriateness of such jurisprudence, in the peculiar case of Nigeria where citizens fall daily to gruesome crimes in an atmosphere of mendacious and arrogant impunity. The unreported decision in James Ajulu & Ors. v. Attorney-General of Lagos State, Suit No: ID/76M/2008, also does not support any inference that the death penalty is illegal. What it raises is the question of the methods and the timing for the carrying out of such executions. But of course, it is desirable to await the Supreme Court?s definitive pronouncement on all the many issues being weaved around the blanket death penalty abolition debates. Similarly, the much-talked about United Nations General Assembly Resolution 62/149 and 63/148 of 2007, purporting to place a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, is not legally binding on Nigeria. It also cannot be elevated to the status of Law in Nigeria except its details are enacted into Law by Nigeria?s valid legislative authorities. Even if Nigeria entered into a Treaty to that effect, such Treaty will possess no force of Law until domesticated and passed into Law in accordance with Section 12 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). Section 12(1) provides: ?No treaty between the Federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the National Assembly.? Moving forward, the arguments against the death penalty are well- known. One of the most famous is that it is doubtful whether it has served as a deterrent for similar crimes, especially homicide. But deterrence or not, it is a moral obligation of the state to give specific justice to victims of heinous crimes. It is important for Nigeria to engage in a lot of circumspection in deciding whether to abolish the death penalty or not. Abolition of death penalty for many classes of crimes is very much desirable. But abolition is certainly untenable in proved cases of premeditated, first degree murder or callous decapitations, such as rape resulting in death, or permanent life threatening and irreparable deformities, occasioned by the perpetrators to their victims. The tendency to uncritical and often merely imitative adoption, of practices unsuited to our circumstances, should not be imported to a question as important as ensuring appropriate restitution for the many unsung and forgotten victims of heinous crimes. What one finds befuddling is that so much rhetoric is reserved for the safety and humanity of the perpetrators of even dastardly murders, while very scanty regard is given to the memory of the real victims left to prematurely decompose in lonely graves far into eternity. This assertion holds true since in the blanket debate for abolition, little attempt is made, if any, to separate crimes of premeditated first degree murder or callous decapitations, in which the imposition of death penalty continues to be both legally and morally justified, from other categories, in which other forms of sentences are preferable. The first consideration for the imposition of death penalty should be restitution for victims of the crime and not deterrence or other fanciful notions. Unfortunately, the abolition debate is increasingly prioritising the protection and survival of the convicted perpetrators of gruesome crimes while largely betraying a befuddling indifference towards the plight of the victims of even very dastardly murders. The first responsibility of the state, where any murder takes place, is to ensure restitution, and direct justice, for the victim. To do otherwise is to deny the dignity of victims while also mocking the memory of law abiding citizens who get felled by perpetrators that now turn round to demand what they gruesomely took away from their victims. While convicted perpetrators of gruesome killings have all shades of opinions advocating for them, one wonders who, in the ?human rights community?, speaks for the many victims of these perpetrators? killings. Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole obviously gets the point and, under such introspective leader, victims of gruesome killings, even though they die, will be glad the state remembered their dignity and acknowledged their irreparable loss.

<p>Listen to Rod Bryant and Jerry Gordon as they interview “Michael”, the older brother of one of the victims, Coty Beavers, who Rod knew. Coty was murdered execution style in November 2012 by father-in-law Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, 60 in his apartment in Houston in a gated community he shared with his wife Nasreen, a Christian convert, who had escaped from her family compound. Irsan was convicted of the murder of Beavers and orchestrating the murder, 11 months earlier, of a colleague of his daughter Nasreen at an M D Anderson medical program, an Iranian American convert and feminist ? women?s rights activist, Gelareh Bagherzade. There is also emerging evidence of multiple honor killings by Irsan including perpetrating a 1999 murder of a potential son-in-law, a Muslim, making it appear as a ?suicide?.</p>

<p>Irsan was convicted in a five week trial in the Harris County District Court for capital murder on July 25, 2018. The trial is currently in the penalty phase when expert testimony may be presented to determine whether Irsan receives a life sentence or death. Irsan who came to the US in 1979 initially settled in Michigan, later moving on to Texas. He held odd jobs ultimately becoming a scam artist of insurance and social security programs. Irsan fathered 12 children by two American wives who he brutally raped, beat and abused.</p>
<p>“Michael”, who courageously consented to this Israel News Talk Radio ? Beyond the Matrix interview said: “Honor killings have no place in American society. These are not infrequent events that happen in some random part of the world. They’re happening in America and they’re on the rise.” Jerry, 3:57 PM</p>

There is also emerging evidence of multiple honor killings by Irsan including perpetrating a 1999 murder of a potential son-in-law, a Muslim, making it appear as a ?suicide?. Advertisement Irsan was convicted in a five week trial in the Harris County District Court for capital murder on July 25, 2018. The trial is currently in the penalty phase when expert testimony may be presented to determine whether Irsan receives a life sentence or death. Irsan who came to the US in 1979 initially settled in Michigan, later moving on to Texas. He held odd jobs ultimately becoming a scam artist of insurance and social security programs. Irsan fathered 12 children by two American wives who he brutally raped, beat and abused. “Michael”, who courageously consented to this Israel News Talk Radio ?

He had been traveling in the car with Eldar Gogoladze, the bodyguard of the former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then part of a four-man governing council that ruled the newly independent Georgia. Accompanying Woodruff and Gogoladze were two Georgian women, one of whom turned out to be a Russian military spy and mafia assassin. Woodruff had arrived in the country in early June of 1993?to help train the country?s security forces. It was the first such mission in the former Soviet Union. Georgia was a lawless nation at the time. Several years earlier, the country had emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and was still overrun with Russian intelligence agents. Crime was rampant and electricity sporadic as rival gangs and paramilitaries competed for influence. Georgia was fighting a separatist insurgency in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. The CIA had also identified the country as a major drug smuggling route. After Woodruff was shot and killed, then-CIA director James Woolsey traveled to Georgia personally to claim the dead?body. Georgian officials determined that the murder?had been an accident and Woodruff had been killed by a stray bullet shot by a drunken soldier who was unaware that there was an American in the car. A trial was held in 1994?and a young man named Anzor Sharmaidze was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for the murder. But Texas lawyer Michael Pullara was not convinced by this explanation. Pullara, a family friend of the Woodruffs who had gone to school with Freddie Woodruff?s sister, was motivated to get to the bottom of the murder. After carefully analyzing the evidence presented during Sharmaidze?s trial in Georgia and issuing numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FBI and CIA, Woodruff became convinced that Sharmaidze was innocent and that Russia was behind the assassination of the CIA agent. In his new book The Spy Who Was Left Behind, Pullara describes in vivid detail his investigation, which spanned decades and borders, and how he linked Woodruff?s murder to Russia?s Special Forces and to veteran CIA agent Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union just months after Woodruff was killed.? Pullara succeeded in having Sharmaidze released from prison in 2008. In 2013, Georgia?s justice minister Tea Tsulukiani said she believes the case ?had not been properly investigated." In a conversation with Newsweek, Pullara describes his hopes for the new book and why he believes it took so long for the truth about Woodruff?s death to be discovered. How long did this investigation take? I started in 1993, literally the day after the murder was presented in The New York Times. I made my first FOIA request in 1994 and I made my first trip to Georgia in 2004. I got Anzor out of prison in 2008. And I was still making trips and trying to reverse the conviction until 2013. I would say, in terms of actively pursuing the case, 2004 to 2009 was the most active period. It never occurred to me to write a book until at one point in the process the State Department accused me of doing the whole project as a publicity stunt in order to write a book. I guess I have them to thank. After Anzor was released from prison he called me and asked me for money. One of my solutions for getting him money was buying his?rights to the book. I paid him upfront. I bought the rights up front in cash, and I will give him some of the proceeds from the book. I wanted him to feel like he was getting fair value for selling his experience.

The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder. So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'"Null"', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a lawyer for a criminal defendant cannot override his client''s wish to maintain his innocence at trial, even if the lawyer''s aim is to avoid a death sentence. The justices voted 6-3 in favor of Louisiana death row inmate Robert McCoy. He repeatedly objected to his lawyer''s decision to acknowledge that McCoy killed the son, mother and step-father of his estranged wife in 2008. Lawyer Larry English said the evidence of McCoy''s guilt was overwhelming. English said his strategy was to seek a sentence of life in prison instead of death. But jurors sentenced McCoy to death anyway. The issue arises in capital cases, though infrequently. In that setting, jurors have to decide separately on guilt and a sentence, and some lawyers devote their defense to avoiding a death sentence. Even so, Louisiana''s Supreme Court had been alone among the highest state courts to allow a lawyer to concede guilt in the face of a client''s objections. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court, said McCoy must be given a new trial. "Even when a criminal defendant is assisted by counsel, some decisions are reserved for the client," Ginsburg said in a summary of her opinion. That includes the decision about whether to assert innocence, she said. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented. While English admitted that McCoy killed the victims, he did not concede that his client was guilty of first-degree murder, Alito wrote in his dissent for the three justices. Overwhelming evidence implicated McCoy in the killings, Alito said. "If petitioner is retried, it will be interesting to see what petitioner''s current counsel...will do," Alito said. Among the evidence was a gun found in the vehicle in which McCoy was riding at the time of his arrest in Idaho that was linked to cartridge casings found at the scene of the killings in Louisiana. McCoy testified in his own defense, saying he was innocent and suggesting that a drug trafficking ring led by law enforcement officers had framed him for the killings. He tried to recruit witnesses he said would vouch for him, including then-Sen. David Vitter. Vitter said he did not know McCoy. The trial court found McCoy was competent to stand trial. English, the trial lawyer, argued consistently that McCoy was in a fragile emotional state and that he lacked the intent to kill that is necessary for a jury to impose the death penalty. English''s view of McCoy''s chances led him to concede in his opening argument that McCoy "committed these crimes." McCoy had told English not to do that. The case is McCoy v.

In the blurry hours of the early morning, she listened as the voice on the end of the phone told her that her younger sister Seeta Kaur, 33, was dead. Seeta?s twin sister, Geeta, delivered the news.</p><p>Earlier, Seeta?s brother-in-law, Jitendra Saini, had called her father and explained that Seeta had died of a heart attack while staying at his family?s home in Kurukshetra, northern India, with her husband and four children. In keeping with Hindu custom, Jitendra said, his family would cremate her.</p><p>Seeta?s father pleaded with Jitendra. ?Do not cremate her,? he told him. ?We want to see her for the last time.? His plea wasn?t motivated only by grief?he was suspicious. His daughter?s husband, Pawan Saini, an Indian citizen and British resident whom he had introduced to Seeta, had been physically abusive for years, her family says. Twice, in London, in 2010 and 2013, Seeta?s sisters had seen him throttling his wife. Her family also says Pawan repeatedly demanded that she let their eldest son move to India to live as something of a surrogate son to Jitendra and his wife, who did not have children of their own. Had Pawan taken Seeta, a British citizen, to India, so that he could kill her in a country where the judicial system is riddled with corruption?</p><p>In London, in the hours after they heard the news, Seeta?s family hurried to book flights to New Delhi. As they packed their bags, her father, a retired grocery store clerk, dispatched his nephew in Mathura, India, to make the five-hour drive to Kurukshetra. The family wouldn?t arrive until April 1, 2015, a full day later. Someone had to guard his daughter?s body.</p><p>When the family eventually arrived in Kurukshetra, dusk was falling. The nephew was still at the house, preventing Jitendra and his family from cremating the body. A large group of mourners were also present, filling the ground floor and spilling onto the street. ?I walked into the living room, and you can see there?s a refrigerated coffin box, glass, and Seeta?s covered from head to toe with blankets, so you couldn?t see the body through the glass,? Swinder says.</p><p>Swinder began forcing her way through the crowd. Once she was by the coffin, she tried to open the box. ?They were pushing me back, shoving me, saying ?don?t touch,?? she says. Fighting them off, she lifted the lid and pulled the covers off her sister. ?I can see all her neck from her upper chest is all bruised, blue and green,? Swinder recalls, her voice cracking. ?So it?s real, you know. You can see all around her neck. She?s been bruised.?</p><p>Swinder remembers turning and screaming at the crowd gathered behind her: ?She didn?t die of a heart attack! You?ve murdered her! You?ve strangled her!?</p><img alt="05_12_HonorKillings_13" class="JsEnabled_Op(0) JsEnabled_Bg(n) Trsdu(.42s) Bgr(nr) Bgz(cv) StretchedBox W(100%) H(100%) ie-7_H(a)" itemprop="url" src="https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif" data-reactid="36" /><p>     Almost two years after Seeta Kaur?s death, the family seems no closer to getting justice. Her four children?a son aged 10, a daughter aged 8 and twins aged 3?remain in India with their father.   Southall Black Sisters   </p><p>In 2000, the United Nations estimated that each year 5,000 women are killed by relatives for supposedly bringing dishonor upon their families. The figure for these so-called honor killings is both outdated and likely inaccurate. A spokesman for the U.N. Population Fund tells Newsweek  that since most honor killings happen ?in areas where the social-cultural foundations are more accepting of this type of activity,? they are often not reported or passed off as natural deaths. (The organization says it updates its statistics periodically and has not yet produced an update on the 2000 figure.) Some countries have their own independent estimates for the number of honor killings, but the familial collusion that frequently surrounds these deaths renders the figures unreliable.</p><p>Rights groups in the U.S. and U.K. believe that transnational honor killings?when family members lure victims overseas to kill them?are a growing phenomenon. From 2010 to 2014, the U.K. human rights think tank the Henry Jackson Society recorded  29 cases of honor killings of people who resided in the U.K., based on media reports. Activists say that what?s striking about the U.K. figure is that 11 of the murders were committed overseas, all of them in Pakistan. It?s impossible to say what the true extent of these out-of-country killings are, the society warned: ?There are no reliable figures on the total number of female British residents and/or citizens who have been killed abroad in the name of honor.?</p><p>Perpetrators of these crimes apparently believe that they stand a better chance of getting away with an honor killing if it occurs in countries, like Pakistan and India, whose police forces and judicial systems suffer from corruption. Officials in the victim?s country of residence are less likely to find out about such a murder, and even if they do, police cannot just travel abroad and launch their own investigation. Unless people close to a victim raise awareness of his or her death and pressure lawmakers to intercede, the crime will usually go unrecognized and unpunished.</p><p>In the U.K., the problem of transnational honor killings attracted widespread public attention in 2016. On July 20, a young woman named Samia Shahid was found dead in Pakistan. Her family had reportedly lured her to the country by saying her father was sick. When she arrived, her ex-husband, assisted by her father, allegedly strangled her.</p><p>Don''t miss: Eminem''s Lose Yourself Played in New Zealand Court in Copyright Lawsuit</p><p>Naz Shah, the member of Parliament for Bradford West?the electoral district in England where Shahid lived?moved quickly when Shahid?s second husband told her about his wife?s death.

I never did that. Obviously, we had arguments like any othe', 9997, N'Swinder Singh was asleep at her home in north London when she got the call. In the blurry hours of the early morning, she listened as the voice on the end of the phone told her that her younger sister Seeta Kaur, 33, was dead. Seeta?s twin sister, Geeta, delivered the news. Earlier, Seeta?s brother-in-law, Jitendra Saini, had called her father and explained that Seeta had died of a heart attack while staying at his family?s home in Kurukshetra, northern India, with her husband and four children. In keeping with Hindu custom, Jitendra said, his family would cremate her. Seeta?s father pleaded with Jitendra. ?Do not cremate her,? he told him. ?We want to see her for the last time.? His plea wasn?t motivated only by grief?he was suspicious. His daughter?s husband, Pawan Saini, an Indian citizen and British resident whom he had introduced to Seeta, had been physically abusive for years, her family says. Twice, in London, in 2010 and 2013, Seeta?s sisters had seen him throttling his wife. Her family also says Pawan repeatedly demanded that she let their eldest son move to India to live as something of a surrogate son to Jitendra and his wife, who did not have children of their own. Had Pawan taken Seeta, a British citizen, to India, so that he could kill her in a country where the judicial system is riddled with corruption? In London, in the hours after they heard the news, Seeta?s family hurried to book flights to New Delhi. As they packed their bags, her father, a retired grocery store clerk, dispatched his nephew in Mathura, India, to make the five-hour drive to Kurukshetra. The family wouldn?t arrive until April 1, 2015, a full day later. Someone had to guard his daughter?s body. When the family eventually arrived in Kurukshetra, dusk was falling. The nephew was still at the house, preventing Jitendra and his family from cremating the body. A large group of mourners were also present, filling the ground floor and spilling onto the street. ?I walked into the living room, and you can see there?s a refrigerated coffin box, glass, and Seeta?s covered from head to toe with blankets, so you couldn?t see the body through the glass,? Swinder says. Swinder began forcing her way through the crowd. Once she was by the coffin, she tried to open the box. ?They were pushing me back, shoving me, saying ?don?t touch,?? she says. Fighting them off, she lifted the lid and pulled the covers off her sister. ?I can see all her neck from her upper chest is all bruised, blue and green,? Swinder recalls, her voice cracking. ?So it?s real, you know. You can see all around her neck. She?s been bruised.? Swinder remembers turning and screaming at the crowd gathered behind her: ?She didn?t die of a heart attack! You?ve murdered her! You?ve strangled her!? Almost two years after Seeta Kaur?s death, the family seems no closer to getting justice. Her four children?a son aged 10, a daughter aged 8 and twins aged 3?remain in India with their father. Southall Black Sisters In 2000, the United Nations estimated that each year 5,000 women are killed by relatives for supposedly bringing dishonor upon their families. The figure for these so-called honor killings is both outdated and likely inaccurate. A spokesman for the U.N. Population Fund tells Newsweek that since most honor killings happen ?in areas where the social-cultural foundations are more accepting of this type of activity,? they are often not reported or passed off as natural deaths. (The organization says it updates its statistics periodically and has not yet produced an update on the 2000 figure.) Some countries have their own independent estimates for the number of honor killings, but the familial collusion that frequently surrounds these deaths renders the figures unreliable. Rights groups in the U.S. and U.K. believe that transnational honor killings?when family members lure victims overseas to kill them?are a growing phenomenon. From 2010 to 2014, the U.K. human rights think tank the Henry Jackson Society recorded 29 cases of honor killings of people who resided in the U.K., based on media reports. Activists say that what?s striking about the U.K. figure is that 11 of the murders were committed overseas, all of them in Pakistan. It?s impossible to say what the true extent of these out-of-country killings are, the society warned: ?There are no reliable figures on the total number of female British residents and/or citizens who have been killed abroad in the name of honor.? Perpetrators of these crimes apparently believe that they stand a better chance of getting away with an honor killing if it occurs in countries, like Pakistan and India, whose police forces and judicial systems suffer from corruption. Officials in the victim?s country of residence are less likely to find out about such a murder, and even if they do, police cannot just travel abroad and launch their own investigation. Unless people close to a victim raise awareness of his or her death and pressure lawmakers to intercede, the crime will usually go unrecognized and unpunished. In the U.K., the problem of transnational honor killings attracted widespread public attention in 2016. On July 20, a young woman named Samia Shahid was found dead in Pakistan. Her family had reportedly lured her to the country by saying her father was sick. When she arrived, her ex-husband, assisted by her father, allegedly strangled her. Don''t miss: Eminem''s Lose Yourself Played in New Zealand Court in Copyright Lawsuit Naz Shah, the member of Parliament for Bradford West?the electoral district in England where Shahid lived?moved quickly when Shahid?s second husband told her about his wife?s death.

In response to his in-laws? allegations of domestic violence, he tells Newsweek?s translator: ?In London, even if you slap a woman, she can go to the police station. I never touched her. I never did that. Obviously, we had arguments like any other family, but I never laid a hand on her.? Pawan claims that he and Seeta discussed their son moving to India only once or twice. He says he told her they were going to India to celebrate their twins? first birthday. (Their other two children were then aged 6 and 8.) He also says he never resigned from his job but kept asking his boss for extensions to his vacation. After Seeta died, Pawan says he decided to remain in India but didn?t notify his boss of the decision. (He showed Newsweek one WhatsApp message in which he told his boss he would return on March 24, not March 4 as planned. His employers declined to comment on his history with the company, citing data protection laws.) Southall Black Sisters says Pawan is lying. The organization, which is campaigning for British police to look into Seeta?s case, has evidence from 26 witnesses, including family, friends, colleagues and clients, that contradicts Pawan?s claims. The witnesses say they either saw him being physically abusive toward both his wife and her young children or heard Seeta describe the alleged violence. (Newsweek has seen a redacted summary of evidence from the 26 witnesses.) Southall Black Sisters also showed Newsweek a letter Seeta had sent to her children?s school principal. In the document, she asks if they can have time off from February 8, 2015, to March 3, 2015, to visit their allegedly sick grandmother in India. The letter makes no mention of celebrating the twins? birthday, which Pawan says was the main point of the trip. The group also sent Newsweek a copy of his P45, a document British workers receive when leaving a job, that shows his employment ended on March 22, 2015, nine days before Seeta?s death. 05_12_HonorKillings_03 Seeta''s family believes she was one of an annual estimate of about 1,000 honor killings in India each year. Swinder Singh Most popular: India-Pakistan Conflict Intensifies After Indian Army Promises Revenge For Alleged Beheading of Soldiers Once Swinder Singh had seen inside her sister?s coffin, she decided she was right to suspect Pawan. Her family had already made inquiries in New Delhi about repatriating the body and Swinder and her father told Pawan they needed to take Seeta back to the U.K. They say he agreed to sign the necessary paperwork at the local police station in the morning. As Pawan?s family laid out bedding, Swinder and her family settled down to try and sleep. As the sun rose on April 2, 2015, they demanded that Pawan take them to the police station to sign the repatriation forms. They wanted to get Seeta?s body away from her husband and to the U.K. for a proper post-mortem. Pawan delayed, Swinder says, for a few hours. Then, at around 10 a.m., he came upstairs and sat before her father. ?He says to my dad: ?I?ve cremated her,?? Swinder says. ?It was shocking. My dad, he just froze.? In response to the family?s horror, Swinder remembers Pawan telling them: ?She was my wife.? Pawan, speaking through a Newsweek translator, disputes Swinder?s comments. ?I went upstairs and said we?re going to cremate your daughter, and they said they didn?t want to come,? Pawan says. ?They didn?t give a reason.? Pawan added that if the family thought he had murdered Seeta, why did they wait until the day after they arrived in India to go to the police? (Swinder says the family was in shock and thought it would be easier to get the necessary documents signed in the morning.) After Pawan delivered the news about Seeta?s cremation, Swinder says she ran downstairs, where the coffin still lay, and stopped short. Had Pawan lied to them? Inside the coffin, the blankets were arranged in the same way as the night before. For the second time, Swinder lifted the lid and pulled down the covers. There was nothing inside. Pawan had indeed cremated her sister, and in doing so, Swinder believes, he destroyed the evidence of her murder. In a daze, she left the house with her father and brother and began asking for directions to the local police station. Swinder says 40 of the mourners followed them to the station hoping, she thinks, to intimidate them and run them out of Kurukshetra. At the police station, the family found the officers lethargic and bored. They couldn?t compile a report, they told Swinder, because their electricity was down. A few hours later, an officer named Ram Kumar interviewed the Saini brothers and then went to speak to the Kaur family. ?Just take your son-in-law and his four children back to the U.K. and don?t do the report,? Swinder recalls him saying. The family ignored the officer and filed a report. For 21 days, they remained in India, begging the police to arrest Pawan and properly investigate Seeta?s death. Swinder says the police kept reassuring them that they were looking into her sister?s case, but she saw little evidence of this. The officer, who has moved to another police station, repeatedly refused to speak to Newsweek about Seeta?s case and the allegations her family has made against him. 05_12_HonorKillings_01 A journalist shows the picture of slain British woman Samia Shahid on a cell phone in Dina, near Jhelum, in eastern Pakistan on September 7, 2016. Her ex-husband and father were charged with her murder, and her ex-husband was also charged with her rape before her death. Her family had reportedly lured her to Pakistan from the U.K. by saying her father was sick. Anjum Naveed/AP Eventually, Seeta?s family flew back to London, forced to leave the four young children with their father. Since the police had not charged Pawan, her family had no claim to them. Still, they reasoned, Seeta was a British citizen?surely the U.K. police would want to pursue her case. But, as Swinder and her family were soon to find, the law wasn?t on their side. There is only one piece of U.K. legislation that applies to transnational honor killings. The 1861 Offences Against the Persons Act covers domestic and transnational murders, as well as acts of manslaughter. The law states that any British citizen who commits murder or manslaughter abroad can be investigated, tried and punished in the United Kingdom. But the 156-year-old law doesn?t include immigrants who do not hold British citizenship, even if, like Seeta?s husband, they are legal permanent residents and even if their alleged victims are British citizens. (The equivalent laws in the United States and Canada similarly legislate only against nationals. France, Germany and Australia?countries that also have significant immigrant populations?do legislate against nationals and residents who commit murder abroad.) In the U.K., Nusrat Ghani, a lawmaker of Pakistani descent, submitted a bill to Parliament addressing honor killings and violence against women that happens abroad. But though she told Parliament Seeta?s death was one of the cases that compelled her to write the bill, it provided only for ?the prosecution in the United Kingdom in certain circumstances of citizens of the United Kingdom? who commit overseas honor killings. The bill did not make it to a second reading. 05_12_HonorKillings_11 Nusrat Ghani speaks at a conference in Manchester on October 6, 2015. Ghani submitted a bill to Parliament addressing honor killings and violence against women that happens abroad, but the bill never made it through to a second reading. Ray Tang/AP For Seeta?s family, the gap in the 1861 law reduces their chances of getting what they see as a just resolution to the case. Six months after the family returned to England, the Indian police told their lawyer in India, Simranjeet Singh (no relation to Swinder Singh), that Seeta had been murdered, but the killer remained untraced. Case closed. Pawan denies the police ever reached the conclusion of murder. The police decision disappointed Seeta?s family. Pragna Patel, founding member of the Southall Black Sisters, tells Newsweek that the Indian police never interviewed Seeta?s family and friends. The conclusion of the investigation meant the family had hit a wall. Indian officials believed the matter over, and U.K. law didn?t allow for the prosecution of Pawan. A British citizen was dead, and her own government seemingly couldn?t help her. Simranjeet Singh is frustrated with U.K. officials. ?It takes years to get justice in India,? he says, speaking from his office in Chandigarh in northern India. Blaming the country?s inefficient and bureaucratic legal system, he adds: ?Often justice is better rendered by a developed foreign authority. I do not understand why the police have not taken action in the U.K.? The lawyer says that the family?s claim that Pawan tried to strangle his wife in London should prompt the city?s police force to carry out their own investigation. In an emailed statement, London?s Metropolitan police told Newsweek they are responding to queries from the Kaur family?s U.K.-based lawyer. (In September, Shamik Dutta, the British lawyer for the Kaur family, asked the police to open their own investigation?including examining Pawan?s actions prior to leaving the U.K.) The British police don?t have to take action on overseas murders, but that doesn?t mean they can?t. If U.K. police officers believe a foreign case merits their involvement, they can offer their assistance to the country in question. This happened in 2014, following the murder of two British backpackers, Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, in Thailand. Their deaths, which were particularly brutal, attracted widespread media attention. Then?U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron leaned heavily on Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to allow British police officers to observe the investigation. At the time, Thai police had arrested two suspects, and Cameron wanted U.K. police to ensure the arrests were the right ones. The Millers and Witheridges, who had expressed concerns about the investigation, subsequently said they believed the Thai police arrested the right people. Seeta?s case did not make the front page of a single newspaper. Nor did the Metropolitan police offer to investigate her death. In a leaflet calling for justice for Seeta, the Southall Black Sisters claimed that Britain is less interested in intervening in cases concerning ?non-white British nationals.? In response, the U.K. Home Office tells Newsweek that individual police forces, and not the government, decide which cases to investigate. Almost two years after Seeta Kaur?s death, the family seems no closer to getting justice. Her four children?a son aged 10, a daughter aged 8 and twins aged 3?remain in India with their father, Pawan Saini, despite a British ruling calling for their return. Swinder Singh, who hasn?t been back to India since her sister?s death two years ago, doesn?t know how they are. She is afraid that she will never see her nephews and nieces again.

<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>

<p>Klein says he is pursuing two issues at the B.C. Court of Appeal on Monday. ?The fundamental question,? he said, ?is whether or not the minister’s actions (by attempting to whisk the two out of a country at the same time new evidence was submitted) amount to an abuse of process, such that a stay of proceedings has to be granted by a court as remedy.?</p>
<p>He says the second issue relates to Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Sept. 28, 2017, about the submitted new evidence, which she found wasn’t significant enough to thwart the extradition process. He wants her decision reviewed by the B.C. Appeal Court.</p>

        <p>By Centre For Social Research,</p>
<p>The Khap has been a system of social administration and organization in the northwestern states of India since ancient times. Written references are found as far back as 2500 BCE. During and since that time, there has been shift from nomadic way of life to settled agricultural practices. From this time on, the Indian social fabric was organized around the village unit and the mode of governing was often that of a council of five, which is called a Panchayat. Khap is a term for a social-political grouping and used in a geographical sense. A Khap originally consisted of 84 villages. A unit of seven villages was called a Thamba and 12 Thambas would form the unit of 84 villages, a khap, together.</p>
<p>However, there are also khaps of 12 and 24 villages. Their elected leaders would determine which units would be represented at the khap level. These khaps are spread all the way from Northwest India down to Madhya Pradesh, Malwa, Rajasthan, Sindh, Multan, Punjab, Haryana, and modern Uttar Pradesh. The Sarv Khap Panchayat represented all the khaps. </p>
<p>The individual khaps would elect leaders who would send delegates, who in their turn would represent the khaps at the Sarv khap level. It was a political organization, composed of all the clans, communities, and castes in the region.  </p>
<p>In the 14th century the upper caste jats used this system to consolidate their power and position. Nowadays the khap panchayats still exist. Although their rulings have no legal validity they are very powerful and are successful in keeping with their so-called traditions. The khap panchayats oppose and annul marriages within the same ?gotra? (lineage) and administer cruel and inhuman punishments to ?erring? couples and their families. Originally the reason for prohibiting these kinds of marriages was that they wanted to lower the number of children born with birth defects. Although this is no longer an issue these gotra marriage are till prohibited on the grounds of ?bhaichara? or brotherly relations and honour. </p>

<p>Gotra  </p>
<p>The term Gotra is a Hindi word for lineage which means the descendants of one individual. Originally, there were 7 Gotras ? Vishv?mitra, Jamadagni, Bharadv?ja, Gautama, Atri, Vasishtha, Kashyapa and Agasthya which was later included in the list. The ramification of the Gotras took place according to the needs in the later stages as the population proliferated. In Hinduism, one cannot marry into one?s own Gotra as the people of same Gotra are considered to be brothers and sisters. However, this rule is not enforced in South India and one can marry into his/her mother?s Gotra. This is not allowed in North India. The system which is fast loosing its value in metropolitian and urban areas, due to modernization, is still prevalent in many rural areas. </p>
<p>States like Western U.P, Haryana and Rajasthan which are quite developed are still governed by the rules of Gotras. In these states, the villagers still swear by the Gotra system of marriage. </p>
<p></p><img src="http://whyogace.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/01slide3.jpg" /> <p></p>
<p>How Khap Panchayats affect life and society  </p>
<p>Recurrently the khap panchayats and their leaders are seen as protectors of the poor but in fact they are aggressors towards these underprivileged couples / families. Instead of helping them they try to impose their judgments on them. Their tyranny is mostly felt in traditional rural habitations since very little or no cases have been reported from urban areas. Their autocracy is specifically evident in the Sarv Khap of Haryana; which influence extended to the Malwa province in Central India, Rajasthan and Sindh. </p>
<p>The khap panchayats have a great effect on the people?s life and the society in a whole. These effects can be either of political, social or economical nature. </p>
<p>Politically  </p>
<p>Violation of the gotra rule usually invites death for the offending couple, while family members are ostracized. It has served as a motive to terminate many young lives, either through murder or forced suicide. The mahapanchayat recently justified their actions by sending a message to the government and courts saying that the khap panchayats were independent of the laws of the land. </p>
<p>As a result, these medieval village-level panchayats function as parallel courts. They govern social norms and pronounce verdicts, which are in contravention of the modern, equitable laws that post-independence India adopted as a democracy. The khap panchayats take over the authority to act as prosecutors and judges without having the legal authority to do so. </p>
<p>Partap Singh, a former MLA and estranged brother of Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, adds that in the absence of norms, khap panchayats are playing havoc with the lives of young couples by issuing diktats at will. </p>
<p>Socially  </p>
<p>The political and juridical power that the khaps have affects the life of many to a great extent. In order to act according to the rules older villages try to keep the young people apart. Some schools are also forced to have separate timings for the boys and girls; or girls are not allowed to go to school at all. Fearing their daughters would go astray, many parents marry them off at an early age. People have unquestionable faith in the justice of khap. The question of rights for women does not exist any where in the territories ruled by Khap panchayats. That girls are seldom sent to schools is especially harmful because education can empower various sections of society, and women in particular, more than anything else. </p>
<p>In some Haryana villages, the young girls are routinely threatened, abused and killed all under Khap verdicts. It is acceptable for the families to feed pesticide pills to the teenage girls and then dispose off their bodies by burning them without any police records. The entire onus of siblinghood rests on the girl. She is the keeper of village honor. Sometimes rules are bend for the boys but a girl is never allowed to bend the rules. If a couple runs away then the families risk a boycott and hefty fines in lakhs of rupees. Even the other women of the house can suffer abuse. </p>
<p>There are multiple other examples of the effect of the ruling of the khap panchayats in daily life. One, for instance, is that in March 2007, the Ruhal Khap banned DJs from playing at marriage parties in Rohtak, citing the ?disturbance to milch animals? as the reason. The real reason for the prohibition was the determination to stop girls from entering dance floors. Soon, three other Khaps joined in, spreading the ban to at least 83 villages around Rohtak. Says Pankaj Ruhal, an activist of Ruhal Khap, ?Women who used to stay indoors started dancing publicly. This is against our tradition.? </p>
<p>Similarly, in May 2001, the Taliban stated that cricket should be banned in Muslim countries. Six years later, in April 2007, Tewa Singh, head of the Daadan Khap banned cricket and watching cricket matches on television in 28 villages in Jind district as ?young boys were going astray?. Says Daadan Khap?s ?secretary?, Jogi Ram, ?Elders should ask their children to play kabaddi, kho-kho and wrestling. Cricket is not a game at all.? Those found guilty, the Khap warned, would be fined ?for seven generations?. Unconfirmed reports state that Khaps near Karnal district have banned television and the radio. </p>
<p>In general, women are not well off under the rule of khap panchayats. In some other parts of India where there are Khap Panchayats, women are considered by them as a commodity. The reproductive roles of women are highlighted under this fold. They are not given any rights and expected to obey their fathers before they are married and fulfill their duties as a wife and as a homemaker after they get married. Women are not even allowed to enter, forget participate in these Khap meetings. Complete exclusion of female counterparts reflects that it is a highly male dominated sphere where women are considered mere objects. Ironically enough, Haryana and Punjab Khap leaders who violently prohibit same Gotra marriages are from areas in which there is a shortage of girls to marry their sons and they are therefore secretly sourcing brides from Jharkhand and other areas. This is due to a skewed sex ratio in the region, thanks to a highly volatile society thriving on gender discrimination. </p>
<p></p><img src="http://infochangeindia.org/images/stories/caste_panchayat.jpg" /> <p></p>
<p>Economically  </p>
<p>As a result of the power of the khap panchayat, Haryana remains completely feudal and patriarchal in terms of attitudes to labor, marriage, inheritance, caste and gender relations. The predominant Jats, as a wealthy farming community, zealously guard their land, females and customs. Exercising control is the key to their social formulations, and khap panchayats serve as instruments towards this end. They are also found in other States, harbouring Jats. For this reason, laborers who do not belong to the Jats do not get a chance to develop themselves in economic respect. </p>
<p>Ranbir Singh, a sociologist who has worked extensively on castes in Haryana gives an interesting explanation for the dominance of Khaps in Haryana. He points out how holding on to ancient customs slows down economic progress. In a research paper he has authored he states, ?Jats, being marginal farmers, have not only been bypassed by the process of economic development but have been further marginalized by it. This is because they could not take advantage of the Green Revolution due to their tiny and uneconomic land holdings, could not enter modern professions due to a lack of academic qualifications and could not take up some other occupations due to caste pride', 9997, N'By Centre For Social Research, The Khap has been a system of social administration and organization in the northwestern states of India since ancient times.

It has served as a motive to terminate many young lives, either through murder or forced suicide. The mahapanchayat recently justified their actions by sending a message to the government and courts saying that the khap panchayats were independent of the laws of the land. As a result, these medieval village-level panchayats function as parallel courts. They govern social norms and pronounce verdicts, which are in contravention of the modern, equitable laws that post-independence India adopted as a democracy. The khap panchayats take over the authority to act as prosecutors and judges without having the legal authority to do so. Partap Singh, a former MLA and estranged brother of Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, adds that in the absence of norms, khap panchayats are playing havoc with the lives of young couples by issuing diktats at will. Socially The political and juridical power that the khaps have affects the life of many to a great extent. In order to act according to the rules older villages try to keep the young people apart. Some schools are also forced to have separate timings for the boys and girls; or girls are not allowed to go to school at all. Fearing their daughters would go astray, many parents marry them off at an early age. People have unquestionable faith in the justice of khap. The question of rights for women does not exist any where in the territories ruled by Khap panchayats. That girls are seldom sent to schools is especially harmful because education can empower various sections of society, and women in particular, more than anything else. In some Haryana villages, the young girls are routinely threatened, abused and killed all under Khap verdicts. It is acceptable for the families to feed pesticide pills to the teenage girls and then dispose off their bodies by burning them without any police records. The entire onus of siblinghood rests on the girl. She is the keeper of village honor. Sometimes rules are bend for the boys but a girl is never allowed to bend the rules. If a couple runs away then the families risk a boycott and hefty fines in lakhs of rupees. Even the other women of the house can suffer abuse. There are multiple other examples of the effect of the ruling of the khap panchayats in daily life. One, for instance, is that in March 2007, the Ruhal Khap banned DJs from playing at marriage parties in Rohtak, citing the ?disturbance to milch animals? as the reason. The real reason for the prohibition was the determination to stop girls from entering dance floors. Soon, three other Khaps joined in, spreading the ban to at least 83 villages around Rohtak. Says Pankaj Ruhal, an activist of Ruhal Khap, ?Women who used to stay indoors started dancing publicly. This is against our tradition.? Similarly, in May 2001, the Taliban stated that cricket should be banned in Muslim countries. Six years later, in April 2007, Tewa Singh, head of the Daadan Khap banned cricket and watching cricket matches on television in 28 villages in Jind district as ?young boys were going astray?. Says Daadan Khap?s ?secretary?, Jogi Ram, ?Elders should ask their children to play kabaddi, kho-kho and wrestling. Cricket is not a game at all.? Those found guilty, the Khap warned, would be fined ?for seven generations?. Unconfirmed reports state that Khaps near Karnal district have banned television and the radio. In general, women are not well off under the rule of khap panchayats. In some other parts of India where there are Khap Panchayats, women are considered by them as a commodity. The reproductive roles of women are highlighted under this fold. They are not given any rights and expected to obey their fathers before they are married and fulfill their duties as a wife and as a homemaker after they get married. Women are not even allowed to enter, forget participate in these Khap meetings. Complete exclusion of female counterparts reflects that it is a highly male dominated sphere where women are considered mere objects. Ironically enough, Haryana and Punjab Khap leaders who violently prohibit same Gotra marriages are from areas in which there is a shortage of girls to marry their sons and they are therefore secretly sourcing brides from Jharkhand and other areas. This is due to a skewed sex ratio in the region, thanks to a highly volatile society thriving on gender discrimination. Economically As a result of the power of the khap panchayat, Haryana remains completely feudal and patriarchal in terms of attitudes to labor, marriage, inheritance, caste and gender relations. The predominant Jats, as a wealthy farming community, zealously guard their land, females and customs. Exercising control is the key to their social formulations, and khap panchayats serve as instruments towards this end. They are also found in other States, harbouring Jats. For this reason, laborers who do not belong to the Jats do not get a chance to develop themselves in economic respect. Ranbir Singh, a sociologist who has worked extensively on castes in Haryana gives an interesting explanation for the dominance of Khaps in Haryana. He points out how holding on to ancient customs slows down economic progress. In a research paper he has authored he states, ?Jats, being marginal farmers, have not only been bypassed by the process of economic development but have been further marginalized by it. This is because they could not take advantage of the Green Revolution due to their tiny and uneconomic land holdings, could not enter modern professions due to a lack of academic qualifications and could not take up some other occupations due to caste pride. Their lot has been made even more difficult by the processes of liberalization, privatization and globalization. Their disenchantment with political leadership has made these pauperized peasants look backwards instead of forward.? The influential khap panchayats also affect the local economy in another way. To a great extent the exert control over the labor market: indirectly they have a say in who gets what kinds of jobs. Women are often neglected and do not get a chance to develop themselves or to become financially independent. Incidents Although their rulings have no legal validity, there is long list of uncivilized ?punishments? meted out to those couples that ?offended? the khap traditions. A couple of examples are: On July 24, 2009, a khap panchayat ?banished? the couple Ravinder and Shilpa and Ravinder?s entire family from their village. The khap panchayat ordered their banishment on the ground that Ravinder is a ?Gehlot? from Dharana, and Shilpa is a ?Kadyan? from Siwah, in Panipat. Now, Ravinder and Shilpa live in Delhi, but they require police escort if they would want to visit their village. The villagers of Singhwal lynched Ved Pal Mor in the very presence of the police, because he married a girl from the same gotra. In June 2009, a khap panchayat forced Manoj and his wife Babli to drink pesticide. An order by the High Court to give police protection to the couple was in vain. In June 2009, another couple, Anita and Sonu, who had ?violated? the khap propriety, was tricked to return to their village, only to be stabbed to death in public. In April 2010, the khaps imposed such a heavy financial penalty on a family of Rajasthan that there was no other alternative for them than to commit suicide. Five members of the family jumped before a running train and took their lives. These incidences highlighted the psychological fear and the tremendous pressure that these khaps generate on the minds of rural poor. Reasons why khaps are powerful Strikingly enough, after all these years, the khaps panchayats are still very powerful, while in fact they have no legal validity. Why has been done so little to stop them and, importantly, why are these terrible things are still happening? First of all, it is due to the inherent weakness of democratically elected Panchayati Raj institutions, Khap panchayats have been powerful. Even the government has not done much to control their power, because they believe that for any administration to take stern action against Khap Panchayats, would be akin to political suicide. Therefore, indirectly, khap panchayats influence politicians to a great extent. The ground reality is that both the police and the gram panchayats either remain silent spectators of or provide passive consent to the inhuman acts. As a result of this policy of appeasement (of the government towards the khap panchayat) the government failed to implement a uniform civil code, as per the constitutional directive. The soporific judicial system only adds to this problem. The nonchalant manner in which human rights are violated in these areas fails to perturb the administration. To make matter worse: families who do try to break free from such abominable acts and rules are helpless as they have to resort to Khaps in case of a dispute. This makes it even more difficult for the villagers to liberate themselves from the Khaps. Verdicts against Khaps Emerging since medieval times, the Khap system is much need of legal reform. In recent times, the Khap system has attracted criticism from groups, citing the stark prejudice that such groups hold against others. The intolerance and anti locution that follows the hate campaign against another group of perhaps lower caste position, lower financial position, as well as sexist attitudes have led to calls for reform and legal action. When it comes to legal action, a Karnal Sessions Court passed a landmark judgment last month, condemning five people to death for killing Manoj and Babli, who married within the same gotra and village, at the behest of the khap panchayat. The khap panchayat expressed its unwavering support for the people who were found guilty and asked villagers to contribute Rs 10 per household to help those found guilty in the case to appeal against their sentence. Another accused was sentenced to seven years in jail on charges of kidnapping and conspiracy. Recent steps taken by Khap Panchayats In modern times where the societal norms are constantly changing, there is always a tiff between the ancient practices being followed and the modern liberal opinion of the youth. This has obviously resulted in a revolt by the practitioners of these ancient customs who believe in restoring it at any cost. On Tuesday 13th of April 2010, 20 khap leaders conferred at a mahapanchayat in Kurukshetra to work out a common strategy for safeguarding their social customs and insulating them against reforms. First of all they resolved to press for an amendment to the Hindu Marriage Act, which would safeguard their right to contract marriages as enjoined by tradition, and presumably punish those who dared flout convention. It was a clear reaction to the growing demand for the Government to clamp down on these bodies, which freely exercise their powers to strike terror in runaway couples that dare to defy their rules. Also they want to make clear that Khaps are not just some people but are oldest panchayats among the Indian community and should be respected. The khap leaders want to take the matter of non-similar surname marriages to each and every home of India. They believe that: ?if the marriages with same surnames were allowed then the society will become selfish as smart people will marry within and the charm of relations will be no more.? The khap panchayats want to achieve all of this even at the cost of lives and they want every household to contribute financially so that they can reach their goals. Epilogue India is going to be one of the developed and the most sought after economies in the world. Yet, there are so many social evils that pose as major barriers to the nation?s progress. Most of these hindrances are to socio ? economic factors. The courts and government need to speedily curtail their powers. India cannot afford to have a parallel justice system, which undoes all the good that was ushered in by its founding fathers. Sadly, consistent genuflection by political parties before people, whose concerns may be contrary to the Indian Constitution, laws and democratic ideal of equality, is to blame for this situation. There are limits to appeasement, and the khap panchayats must be expeditiously cut down to size. Also, the tyranny unleashed by khap panchayats on the pretext of safeguarding tradition needs to be quelled under threat of severe punishment. The Khap Panchayat justice has been compared to the Taliban type kangaroo courts. The comparison is not entirely true but to pass verdicts by people and to take over the authority to act as prosecutors and judges in many cases without having the legal authority to do so, should not be possible in this era.

Corrections officials said they found Andrew Urdiales, 54, unresponsive during a security check at San Quentin State Prison late Friday. He was sentenced to death on Oct. 5 by an Orange County judge for killing five women in California, and previously faced the death penalty for three murders in Illinois. The California victims were Robbin Brandley, 23, in January 1986 in Mission Viejo; Maryann Wells, 31, in September 1988 in San Diego; Julie McGhee, 29, in July 1988 in Cathedral City; Tammie Erwin, 20, in April 1989 in Palm Springs; and Denise Maney, 32, in March 1995 in Palm Springs.

He had been on California’s death row since Oct. 12. Separately, authorities say they found Virendra Govin, 51, unresponsive alone in his cell in a different death row housing unit late Sunday. Govin was sentenced in December 2004 for committing four Los Angeles County murders. The victims were Gita Kumar, 42; Plara Kumar, 18: Tulsi Kumar, 16; and Sitaben Patel, 63. Govin, his brother Pravin Govin, and Carlos Amador, then set the Kumars’ home on fire in 2002. Govin arrived on death row in January 2005. His brother, Pravin, has been on death row since September 2005. Officials said that while both men’s deaths are being investigated as suicides, there is no indication that their deaths are related. California has not executed anyone since 2006 and inmates are far more likely to die from suicide or old age. Since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978, 79 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, 25 have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri, and one was executed in Virginia. There currently are 740 offenders on California’s death row.

Two minutes before it was set to begin at 7 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court denied Zagorski''s appeal on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of choosing between the electric chair and lethal injection. As dark clouds loomed over Riverbend Maximum Security Institution and the sunset changed the sky from bright pink to black, a police-escorted van arrived. Eight people believed to be family members of the victims entered the prison to witness the execution. They waited in front of a covered large window that looked into the execution chamber where on the other side of the glass Zagorski sat pinned in the electric chair, held down by buckles and straps with electrodes fastened to his feet.

She also said there were signs that Zagorski was breathing during a short pause before the second jolt was administered for 15 seconds. The doctor overseeing the death appeared in view to check on Zagorski. Zagorski was dead. The blinds into the chamber closed. Ten minutes later, the victims'' families exited the building and drove away in the van without speaking publicly. "First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don?t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I?m good," Zagorski said before he was taken from his cell to the execution chamber, according to Henry. "It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him." Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago. His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11. The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death. Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection. Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court. But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward. Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard. Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve. An unheard childhood Zagorski grew up poor in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998. His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal. He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10. He developed a stutter. He had no eye glasses for a time, despite having poor vision. At an early age, he was exposed to drugs and alcohol. MORE: Edmund Zagorski spent 34 years behind bars with little visitors Zagorski had ?minor skirmishes with the law as a juvenile and federal drug convictions as an adult,? the appeals documents show, but had no convictions for violent crime before the murders of John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter in April, 1983. If the jurors had known this, Zagorski and his team argued, it would have kept him from the death penalty. A ''calculated'' murder On April 23, Dotson was making plans with his friend Porter to meet a man he knew as Jesse Lee Hardin to buy 100 pounds of marijuana. Posing as Hardin, Zagorski told Dotson he?d worked as a mercenary in South America and worked a stint drilling for oil near New Orleans. Though not more than acquaintances, the men agreed to meet Zagorski and authorities later found their bodies in a secluded, wooded area near Interstate 65 in Robertson County. When her husband didn?t return home after the meeting, Marsha Dotson said she knew immediately something had happened. Although search efforts began right away, the bodies of Porter and Dotson weren''t found for about two weeks. There was a national manhunt for Zagorski. He was eventually spotted in Ohio and was apprehended after a shootout with police. The inmate?s statements about his time in South America could never be verified, according to Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley, who was an assistant district attorney in 1984 who tried the case and sought the death penalty. ?Whether he was or not, who knows,? the prosecutor said. ?He was apparently a very convincing person to make friends and get these people to believe enough to go out into the woods with him.? SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: The most thorough coverage starting from the moment news breaks A fight for a ''rehabilitated man'' In the 1984 trial, life without parole not an option. It''s a point Zargorski''s attorney Robert Hutton pushed in the petition to commute his sentence. The jury did not have the option to sentence him to life without parole because their only options in the 1984 trial were death or the life with the possibility of parole. Six of the surviving jurors in the case agreed life without parole was an appropriate sentence for Zagorski, the clemency request stated. Today, a death sentence would not be given if just one juror wanted life without parole And while Marsha Dotson for more than 30 years wanted nothing more than to see Zagorski put to death for his crimes, she has since "softened." ?I?ve come to realize that it?s not my place to condemn somebody, to let them die. I can?t play God," Dotson said. Hutton also argued Zaroski has also shown "exemplary" behavior during his prison term as a "rehabilitated man." He never received a single disciplinary infraction and testimonies from officers and volunteers detail his trustworthy, hardworking, respectful and peacekeeping demeanor. "His extraordinary rehabilitation demonstrates that if you commute Ed''s sentence, he will continue to make the prison community a safer place for both officers and inmates," Hutton wrote in the petition. The Roman Catholic bishops of the Nashville and Knoxville dioceses have also spoken out ahead of Zagorski''s execution. What''s next for executions in Tennessee? The debate of capital punishment has burned hot in Tennessee. Like many states, Tennessee?s death penalty law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. ?READ MORE: Knoxville attorney played role in Georgia''s elimination of electric chair Officials moved quickly to pass new laws governing the punishment in 1975. But legal challenges kept the death penalty on hold, and it wasn?t until 2000 that an execution was carried out. Six men were put to death by lethal injection and one was executed by electric chair through 2009. A hiatus followed until Irick''s execution on Aug. 9. Irick and Zagorski were part of a group of 32 death row offenders suing the state over its lethal injection method. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 majority in October the drugs can continue in Tennessee even though medical experts said the state''s controversial three-drug protocol tortures inmates to death. The state in the past has also gone back and forth on whether the electric chair should be used again. It''s unclear how Zagorski''s request for the chair will impact executions in the state moving forward but expert on executions predicts more death row inmates could follow his lead. Death row inmate David Earl Miller is set to be executed in early December. Miller, 61, was convicted of killing a disabled woman in South Knoxville with a fire poker in 1981. He is the longest current member of Tennessee''s death row.

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>
<p>An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.</p>

<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>
<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you.

The Bonner County Daily Bee reports that 21-year-old Jacob Corban Coleman pleaded guilty Friday. Prosecutors dropped their pursuit of the death penalty as part of the plea deal. Police say Coleman in August 2017 called a cab and 22-year-old Gagandeep Singh of Spokane picked him up at Spokane International Airport. Authorities say Coleman told police he became homicidal and bought a knife during a stop at a store. Singh stopped in Kootenai, Idaho, when it became clear Coleman didn''t have a destination. Police say Coleman then stabbed Singh, who died at the scene. A two-day sentencing hearing for Coleman is scheduled for Jan. 3. ___ Information from: Bonner County (Idaho) Daily Bee, http://www.bonnercountydailybee.com (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder. So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact.

Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

		<p>The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder.</p>
<p>The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu.</p>
<p>It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class.</p>
<p>The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice.</p>
<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>
<p>?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time a justice minister has tried to execute India’s extradition request.</p>
<p>In 2014, then-justice minister Peter MacKay, after receiving assurances from India there would be no death penalty, and that consular staff could visit the two in prison, agreed to a surrender order for Badesha and Sidhu.</p>
<p>This was after B.C. Judge Gregory Fitch ruled that ?a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the respondents, enraged by the victim?s defiance of their authority, hired the Indian perpetrators to commit the murder.?</p>
<p>However, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the surrender order because Basheda’s and Sidhu’s health and safety might be endangered in an Indian jail.</p>
<p>Klein says he is pursuing two issues at the B.C. Court of Appeal on Monday. ?The fundamental question,? he said, ?is whether or not the minister’s actions (by attempting to whisk the two out of a country at the same time new evidence was submitted) amount to an abuse of process, such that a stay of proceedings has to be granted by a court as remedy.?</p>
<p>He says the second issue relates to Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Sept. 28, 2017, about the submitted new evidence, which she found wasn’t significant enough to thwart the extradition process. He wants her decision reviewed by the B.C. Appeal Court.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’s another delay in the pursuit of justice for Jassi Sidhu, and part of the tragic story of a Canadian citizen murdered in another country because of what may have been beliefs about a woman’s role in a patriarchal system.</p>
<p>Jassi Sidhu was born in Canada and grew up on a large family estate in Maple Ridge, B.C., a community about 40 kilometres from Vancouver. The head of the household was her uncle Badesha, who had left India in the 1970s and had become a wealthy blueberry farmer.</p>
<p>By the time his niece was in her early 20s and working at a local beauty salon, her uncle had arranged a marriage for her to one of his business associates, a much older man.</p>
<p>But she had already secretly married a man her own age whom she had met in India: Sukhwinder Singh Sidhu (known in court documents as ?Mithu?).</p>
<p>Her family was furious, and when she returned alone to Canada, she had to have the RCMP escort her from the family compound in Maple Ridge so she could join her husband in Punjab.</p>
<p>She told the RCMP and Punjabi police she feared for her life. ?</p>
<p>In India on June 8, 2000, she and Mithu were ambushed by a gang of men brandishing hockey sticks and a sword. Mithu was badly cut and Jassi was abducted and pushed into a car. She was found the next day on the road with her throat slit. She was 24 years old.</p>

<p>As the massacre of synagogue worshippers in Pittsburgh piles atop the massacre of white Baptist church worshippers in Texas and the massacre of a black-church study group in Charleston, atop the massacres in Las Vegas, Sandy Hook and too many other places around the country, I?ll keep right?on saying what I did here in 2014: What''s killing us is that the Supreme Court, both political parties, most?civil liberties advocates and most journalists continue to indulge the relentless, intrusive and mindless commercial "speech" of shareholder-driven corporations, including "media" companies and social media platforms, that do not deserve First Amendment protection.</p>

<p>For centuries most Americans have believed that ?the shot heard ?round the world? in 1775 from Concord, Massachusetts, heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history. Early observers of America such as G.W.F. Hegel, Edward Gibbon and Edmund Burke believed that, too. A new kind of republican citizen was rising, amid and against adherents of theocracy, divine-right monarchy, aristocracy and mercantilism. Republican citizens were quickening humanity?s stride toward horizons radiant with promises never before held and shared as widely as they were in America.</p>
                    
    
<p>The creation of the United States really was a Novus ordo seclorum, a New Order of the Ages, a society?s first self-aware, if fumbling and compromised, effort to live by the liberal expectation that autonomous individuals could govern themselves together without having to impose religious doctrines or mystical narratives of tribal blood or soil. With barely a decorous nod to The Creator, the founders of the American republic conferred on one another the right to have rights, a distinguished group of them constituting the others as ?We, the people.?</p>
<p>That revolutionary effort is not just in trouble now, or endangered, or under attack, or reinventing itself. It?s in prison, with no prospect of parole, and many Americans, including me, who wring our hands or wave our arms about this are actually among the jailers, or we?ve sleepwalked ourselves and others into the cage and have locked ourselves in. We haven?t yet understood the shots fired and heard ?round the world from 74 American schools, colleges and military bases since the Sandy Hook School massacre of December 2012.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>These shots haven?t been fired by embattled farmers at invading armies. They haven?t been fired by terrorists who?ve penetrated our surveillance and security systems. With few exceptions, they haven?t been fired by aggrieved non-white Americans. They?ve been fired mostly by young, white American citizens at other white citizens, and by American soldiers at other American soldiers, inside the very institutions where republican virtues and beliefs are nurtured and defended.</p>
<p>They?ve been fired from within a body politic so drained of candor and trust that, beneath our continuing lip-service to republican premises and practices, we?ve let a court conflate the free speech of flesh-and-blood citizens with the disembodied wealth of anonymous shareholders.

Daniel Aaron? characterized as ?ethical and pragmatic, disciplined and free.?</p>
<p>Many Americans are adapting to living with variants of force and fraud that erupt in road rage; lethal stampedes by shoppers on sale days; security precautions in their homes against the prospect of armed invasion; gladiatorialization and corruption in sports; nihilism in entertainment that fetishizes violence without context and sex without attachment ; the casino-like financing of utterly unproductive economic activities such as the entertainment I''ve just mentioned and the predatory lending that has tricked millions out of their homes; the commercial groping and goosing of private lives and public spaces, even in the marketing of ordinary consumer goods; and the huge, new prison industry that Americans have created to deter or punish broken, violent men, most of them non-white, only to find schools in even the whitest, ?safest? neighborhoods imprisoned by fear of white gunmen who?ve often been students themselves.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>Abroad, meanwhile, thousands more shots, fiendish and celebratory, are being fired into the corpses of American national-security and nation-building projects by terrorists and fanatics we were told had been decimated. These projects cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, limbs, homes and hopes, including those of American soldiers, contractors and idealists.

<p>Stressed by all this republican derangement, millions are spending billions on palliatives, medications, addictions and even surveillance designed to protect them from themselves. All those vials, syringes, security systems and shootings reflect the insinuation of what Gibbon called ?a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire?? until Roman citizens ?no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.? Only a few late-Roman republicans, recalling their old freedoms, concluded, with Livy, that ?We have become too ill to bear our sickness or their cures.?</p>

<p>True enough, the republic thus limned by Emma Lazarus in ?The New Colossus,? her poem for the Statue o', 9997, N'Four years ago I published this essay in Salon: It predicted the rise of a demagogue, and much of what would follow Possibly nothing annoys readers of journalism more than a columnist or essayist saying, ?I told you so.? I told you so. On July 4, 2014, a recent spate of American public massacres prompted me to post the following essay?here in Salon.?It was long before anyone was ready to blame the mayhem on more than terrorism, mental illness, the traffic in guns or demented white men. I insisted that something worse was in play, something even more dangerous than a particular strain of demagoguery that would mobilize the resentments?of white, working-class Americans behind someone more awful than Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. Immediately after?Salon?posted this essay, it was re-posted by the British website?openDemocracy, by?Reset?(in Rome), and by the American sites AlterNet and?History News Network. Salon''s?post was noted by the Drudge Report, website, which sent thousands of negative comments our way. The essay also provoked responses such as this?one by conservative theologian Carl Raschke, who dubbed me an ?op-ed Jeremiah.? It prompted?this tweet from?Hendrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker: Having thought that I was pretty much alone in wringing my hands over the imminent demise of the American republic, I was surprised by the volume and vehemence of the reactions. (I found Hertzberg''s "compliment" a bit unnerving, since I grew up six miles north of the spot where, in 1741, Edwards, the Puritan divine, delivered his own jeremiad, "Sinners in the hands of an angry God.") What surprises me now,?on re-reading the essay,?is how presciently -- I won?t say ?prophetically? -- it anticipated the severity of a republican crisis that many Americans now acknowledge but that most keep trying to normalize, deflect or minimize. Let me say right now what the following jeremiad of 2014 makes obvious: Donald Trump isn''t?the cause of what?s plaguing us. He?s only the most prominent among many other carriers and casualties of the?disease I diagnose here.

And it still had a guiding aristocracy of sorts, but supposedly only "an aristocracy of talent and virtue," as Jefferson put it, and not one of blood and ill-gotten wealth.?True, too, certain lingering Puritan beliefs had nourished in the embattled farmers (and, even long before 1775, in some of the Puritans themselves) a conviction that resistance to tyranny is obedience to God. That injunction to defy worldly power sometimes in the name of a Higher Power legitimated individual conscience and autonomy right up through the nonviolent defiance of the best of the civil-rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. But the American emphasis on individual conscience and autonomy also gestated a liberal capitalist republic that has reduced individualism to market exchanges in ways that are now destroying both individuals and the society. A liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily certain public virtues and beliefs that neither the liberal state nor markets can nourish or defend. The liberal state isn?t supposed to judge between one way of life and another, after all; and markets reward you as a self-interested consumer and investor, not as a citizen who might put such interests aside at times to advance a greater good that self-interest alone can''t achieve. The moral silence and often bankruptcy of states and markets leaves citizen-leaders to be nourished and trained all the more intensively in institutions that stand somewhat apart from the state and markets. The Puritan founders of America?s oldest colleges understood this, but they expected that those colleges'' graduates would serve a theocratic state that would control markets and everything else.?We?re right to dismiss the Puritans? theocracy because it was repressive and hypocritical. But we''re wrong to have lost a side of its animating spirit that would have kept markets from controlling and devouring republican government and even our bodies and ourselves. Symptoms and scapegoats hide the disease Having miscarried republican self-discipline and conviction so badly, we find ourselves scrambling to monitor, measure and control the consequences, such as the proliferation of mental illness and the glorification and marketing of guns, as if these were causing our implosion. They aren?t. They?re symptoms, not causes -- reactions to widespread heartbreak at the breakdown of what Tocqueville called republican habits of the heart that we used to cultivate. Equally symptomatic, not causal, are self-avowedly ?deviant? and ?transgressive? gyrations by people who imagine that the sunset of civic-republican order heralds a liberating, Dionysian dawn. Sloughing off our bad old repressions, we?ve been swept up by the swift market currents that turn countercultures into over-the-counter cultures and promote a free-for-all that?s a free-for-none as citizens become customers chasing ?freedoms? for sale. Even our war-makers? and -mongers? grand strategies and the growing militarization of our domestic police forces are more symptomatic than causal of the public derangement that''s rising all around us. But turning the bearers of such frightening symptoms into our primary villains or scapegoats would only deepen our blindness to the disease, which is as old as the biblical worship of the Golden Calf and as new as Goldman Sachs. It runs deeper than anything that anyone but the Puritans and their Old Testament models tried to tackle. I''m not suggesting we can or should return to Puritanism! Anyone expecting to recover that faith and way of life is stumbling up dry streambeds toward wellsprings that have themselves run dry. But we do need wellsprings that could fortify us to take risks even more daunting than those taken by the embattled farmers. We''d somehow have to reconfigure or abandon empty comforts, escapes and protections that both free-market conservatives and readers of Salon are accustomed to buying and selling, sometimes against our own best hopes and convictions. Our cure would also require reweaving a fabric of public candor and comity strong enough to resist the rise of?ressentiment, a public psychopathology, once associated with the rise of fascism, in which insecurities, envy and hatreds that many have been nursing in private converge in scary public eruptions that diminish their participants even in seeming to make them big.?Ressentiment?s??little-big man? seeks easy targets for frustrations borne of exploitation by powers that he''s afraid to face and reckon with head-on. Blaming scapegoats warps his assessment of his hardships and options and drives him to wreak vengeance on them as soon as there are enough little-big men (and women, of course) to do so?en masse?under a Glenn Beck or a Sarah Palin. Whether?ressentiment?erupts in racist violence, sectarian fanaticism, anti-Communist witch hunts, totalitarian show trials, politically correct cultural revolutions or sadistic escapism, its most telling symptoms are paranoia and routinized bursts of hysteria. Under the ministrations of gifted demagogues, its grievances and pain assume a fleeting brilliance that soon collapses, tragi-comically or catastrophically, on its own cowardice and lies. Its targets often shift. The 9/11 attacks brought a reprieve of sorts to African-Americans, the republic?s most enduring scapegoats, when the burden of white censure pivoted toward Muslims. Louis Farrakhan?s Nation of Islam lost credibility, but so did whites such as the neoconservative Daniel Pipes, who kept on insisting years after 9/11 that the first black president was a Muslim and a friend of terrorists. The slipperiness of scapegoating became clear to me in 1993, as I?wrote?about a deranged black gunman, Colin Ferguson, who?d opened fire in a Long Island Rail Road car, killing six passengers. Even while holding him responsible, I saw him bearing symptoms far more widespread than his private demons. Noting Ferguson?s enthusiasm for a politics of rage, paranoia and death threats then prominent on a black radio station and in demagogic street politics, I warned that even deranged loners are sometimes better attuned to our subconscious hatreds and fears than we care to admit.?That was true, too, of?Jared Loughner,?the white paranoid-schizophrenic and anti-government fantasist who killed a U.S. District Court judge and six other people while trying to kill but severely wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 13 others in 2011. While apocalyptic religious and racist ranting can provoke emotionally disturbed people, so can journalism and entertainment that massage hatreds too diffuse to be called racist, religious or ideological. Some school shooters nursed the depictions of violence and lust that are?pumped incessantly?into young Americans? horizons with the help of new technologies and investment strategies that ride reckless misreadings of the First Amendment.?This hasn?t been done with malevolent intent as often as it?s been done in a kind of civic mindlessness by media corporations incentivized and indeed forced by market pressures to bypass our brains and hearts on the way to our lower viscera and wallets by exaggerating fears of armed home invasion, government takeover and vengeful victory by gunplay. The invisible disease Even though relatively few young Americans follow these siren songs into acts of destruction, the public fetishizing of sex and violence without context or caring dampens many others? faith in society during their formative years. You don?t need to know a lot of developmental psychology or anthropology to know that children crave culturally coherent tests of prowess and loyalty in symbolic rites of passage that ratify their communal belonging. When such rites and symbols fail, some flail about, seeking order in private delusions, Dartmouth College fraternities and public orchestrations of?ressentiment. In 1775, most American communities still filtered such basic generational and human needs through traditions that encompassed kinship bonds and seasonal rhythms. In "Common Sense," Thomas Paine could urge readers to take their recent experiences of monarchy ?to the touchstones of nature? and decide whether they would abide the empire''s abuses.?Today, those "touchstones of nature" -- and with them, republican convictions about selfhood and society -- have been torn up by runaway engines and developments in technology, communications and even intimate biology that would terrify Paine, Adam Smith and John Locke, not to mention those who fired the first shot at Concord. This time, we''re all in bed with the enemy. In "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" 40 years ago, Daniel Bell -- no anti-capitalist, but prophetic enough about the worship of Golden Calves -- argued that free markets no longer make free men because "economic liberalism has become? corporate oligopoly, and, in the pursuit of private wants, a hedonism that is destructive of social needs." He warned that consumer capitalism displaces the needs that the early republic filtered through nature?s rhythms and kinship traditions. It displaces those needs with ginned-up ?wants? that ?by their nature, are unlimited and insatiable?. [T]he rational calculation of efficiency and return? displace ?the principle of the public household," strip-mining and selling off fragments of cultural narratives. Without civic wellsprings and narratives deep and compelling enough to strengthen a society?s adhesives and disciplines in the hearts of its young, neither free-market conservatives nor world-is-flat neoliberal cosmopolitans can reconcile their professed commitments to ordered, republican liberty with their knee-jerk obedience to riptides of destructive investment that are dissolving republican virtue and sovereignty before our eyes. No wonder we?re losing our vision, in both senses of the word: Our foreign-policy savants across the ideological spectrum were too blind to see that the Soviet Union was so much weaker than American Cold War propaganda and hysteria insisted that it imploded in 1989. The fabled "missile gap" that John F. Kennedy ran on in 1960 was as imaginary as Saddam Hussein''s WMD, but anyone who tried telling either of those truths was charged with a ?failure of nerve? or worse by the blind warmongers in our midst. Our business press was too blind to see that a tsunami of predatory lending would wreck the national economy and throw millions from their homes. Our market-addled congressional committees and blue-ribbon commissions on national intelligence couldn?t discover, until Edward Snowden revealed it, that public surveillance had taken on an all-devouring life of its own. Neoconservative and Vulcan conservative advocates of using American military force to spread democracy abroad couldn?t see that their strategy was doomed because democracy isn''t woven that way and because it was destroying democracy at home in ways that, if unchecked, will destroy the republic whose strengths they''ve so badly misconstrued and betrayed. Our consumer society, addicted to cheap comforts and quick fixes, can''t see its own Orwellian ensnarement by commercial censors, and it couldn?t take Al Gore?s "Inconvenient Truth? about global warming seriously enough to offset the onrushing damage with the serious sacrifices we have yet to make. Our gilded political consultants, pollsters and campaign donors were too blind to see the boiling undercurrents that have swept away House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Nor can they see that Cantor?s political demise presages an inflammation of?ressentiment?so wild that the coming, specious, ?Who Lost Iraq?? debate will be accompanied by the shot that some military veteran who feels betrayed will fire at a politician who?s been left holding the empty bag of our civic-republican hopes. So we are flying almost totally blind, punched bloody by a Hand that we keep insisting is Invisible. We can see only the sickness of the gunmen and of the proliferation of their guns. Treatment of those symptoms is urgently needed, but it will be insufficient to curb the wrecking ball that global capitalism has become on our willfully blind watch, and triage won''t renew the civic fabric. Exemplary defiance has its place Whenever republican candor and courage have seemed about to succumb like this to tribal and theocratic delusions or to force and fraud in the past, some citizens have roused others to fend off threats to republican premises and practices: In 1776 a young schoolteacher named Nathan Hale was caught trying to track and expose the military and intelligence operations of the only established, legitimate government of his time. But just before his hanging he said, ?I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country? and became an incarnation of a nascent republic. Hale''s dignity in adversity, unfathomable to many of us these days, anticipated that of Martin Luther King Jr. and the black churchgoers who walked unarmed and trembling toward armed men and dogs with nothing but their faith and their long-shot strategy to delegitimate the seemingly impregnable segregationist establishment of their time by appealing to republican principles and an American civil religion whose theology was as vague as that of the founders. Hale?s dignity also anticipated that of three Yale seniors I came upon one wintry morning in 1968 as they gave university chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. their military draft cards to announce their resistance to the U.S. government on behalf of the American republic. ?The government says we?re criminals, but we say the government is criminal for waging this war,? said one of the seniors, struggling to find his voice. For all we knew, these guys were about to be arrested on the spot, and some of us felt arrested morally by their example because they were ready to pay the penalty of law in order to affirm their commitment to honest law itself. Coffin, who held to a Calvinist theology that, like King?s, saw resistance to tyranny as obedience to God, was present to bless a courage that few national-security state conservatives understand, in the idiom of an American civil religion few neoliberals and postmodern leftists understand. When he quoted Dylan Thomas? ?Do not go gentle into that good night; rage, rage, against the dying of the light,? that civil religion seemed to awaken briefly and to walk and talk again, re-moralizing the state and the law, and the silent, wild confusion I was feeling gave way to something like awe. (I described this experience?in The Washington Monthly in 2000, during the protracted ?election? of George W. Bush.) Hale?s courage also anticipated Edward Snowden?s. Both young men may have been impetuous and otherwise flawed in some respects, but they showed that resistance to corrupted power requires not only prowess, means, and will, but an elusive, republican sensibility that?s cultivated in civil society and confirmed in little daily interactions long before it emerges in demonstrations of civic courage that startle and move other citizens. With a wonderment somewhat like Hegel?s, the German political philosopher J?rgen Habermas marveled at this ?constitutional patriotism? in American citizens who possessed what Gibbon described as ?that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honor, the presence of danger, and the habit of command.? When I tell young millennials these stories, though, many of them listen pretty much as they would to tales about knights in shining armor, long ago and far away. Much closer to them are the school shootings and internet mayhem that make brave citizenship seem archaic, implausible and irrelevant to self-discovery and social change. Yet republican expectations do have ways of resurfacing whenever ?We, the people? begin to imagine what our lives would be like, singly and together, if we had to live without them. Not everyone can be seduced or intimidated away from them. Still, so many Americans are generations removed from any easily recoverable religious or ethno-racial identity or other adhesive that we have to ask: Where are the touchstones or narratives strong enough renew public virtues and beliefs that neither markets nor the liberal state do much to nourish or defend? Nourishing a new liberal order The question should prompt a quest for a political culture that isn?t too commercial and vapid and that isn''t held together only by demagoguery and delusion. No reconfiguration of today?s capitalism will be possible without something better than that. Yet no think tank, legislature or foundation can carry that quest or that reconfiguration to a just conclusion. Nor can an Occupy Wall Street that isn?t grounded in something deeper than its own noble effort to?be?the change it wants us all to make. Nor can our ?illness? be cured by champions of a new foreign-policy??realism? such as Robert Kagan, who?urge us to face the inevitable challenges?of a world where only willpower and force can sustain the liberal order that many Americans take for granted. That?s right as far as it goes,?but it begs the question of where willpower comes from and what, within the liberal order itself, is sapping that willpower. Quoting Michael Ignatieff, Kagan speculates candidly that liberal civilization itself ?runs deeply against the human grain and is achieved and sustained only by the most unremitting struggle against human nature.? Perhaps, Kagan adds, ?this fragile democratic garden requires the protection of a liberal world order, with constant feeding, watering, weeding, and the fencing off of an ever-encroaching jungle.? But he can?t seem to face the challenge posed by the new shots heard ?round the world from America: The jungle and its encroachments begin not only abroad but within our own garden. What seems our greatest weakness could be one of our greatest strengths, although it, too, won''t be enough: Even 150 years after the founding, the philosopher George Santayana?wrote?that Americans still heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history precisely because they?d ?all been uprooted from their several soils and ancestries and plunged together into one vortex, whirling irresistible in a space otherwise quite empty. To be an American is of itself almost a moral condition, an education and a career?.? Although there?s plenty to regret and respect in the traditions we?ve lost, there?s no turning back from the ?moral condition? and ?career? we face as citizens. We have no choice but to keep faith with the republic and one another. If Americans have a manifest destiny now, it?s to lead in weaving a new republican fabric that markets can serve but not subvert. In 2008, Barack Obama seemed to incarnate so brilliantly the promise of weaving our diversity into a new republican discipline -- he even invoked Puritan and biblical wellsprings in some of his speeches -- that many people ?round the world considered him a prophet who would satisfy their hunger for new narratives. Probably no national political leader ever can do that. The narratives the world needs now will have to come from other prophets and leaders yet unsung. I do think that Americans will be strong among them, if only because we?ve had so much experience generating that hunger by generating the civic-republican-capitalist effort that has failed.', 28851, N'no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the ...', N'Our republic is in crisis — and it’s killing us.

Corrections officials said they found Andrew Urdiales, 54, unresponsive during a security check at San Quentin State Prison late Friday. He was sentenced to death on Oct. 5 by an Orange County judge for killing five women in California, and previously faced the death penalty for three murders in Illinois.

He had been on California’s death row since Oct. 12. Separately, authorities say they found Virendra Govin, 51, unresponsive alone in his cell in a different death row housing unit late Sunday. Govin was sentenced in December 2004 for committing four Los Angeles County murders. The victims were Gita Kumar, 42; Plara Kumar, 18: Tulsi Kumar, 16; and Sitaben Patel, 63. Govin, his brother Pravin Govin, and Carlos Amador, then set the Kumars’ home on fire in 2002. Govin arrived on death row in January 2005. His brother, Pravin, has been on death row since September 2005. Officials said that while both men’s deaths are being investigated as suicides, there is no indication that their deaths are related. California has not executed anyone since 2006 and inmates are far more likely to die from suicide or old age. Since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978, 79 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, 25 have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri, and one was executed in Virginia. There currently are 740 offenders on California’s death row.

Two minutes before it was set to begin at 7 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court denied Zagorski''s appeal on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of choosing between the electric chair and lethal injection. As dark clouds loomed over Riverbend Maximum Security Institution and the sunset changed the sky from bright pink to black, a police-escorted van arrived. Eight people believed to be family members of the victims entered the prison to witness the execution. They waited in front of a covered large window that looked into the execution chamber where on the other side of the glass Zagorski sat pinned in the electric chair, held down by buckles and straps with electrodes fastened to his feet. The blinds opened for the rest of the witnesses to see Zagorski dressed in his cotton clothes, smiling and grimacing to the group. Zagorski pronounced his last words: "Let?s Rock." He sat in the wired chair as prison staff placed a wet sponge that had been soaked in saline solution, and metal helmet on his freshly shaved head.

Henry said both pinkies appear to either be dislocated or broken due to the force as he pulled against the straps. She also said there were signs that Zagorski was breathing during a short pause before the second jolt was administered for 15 seconds. The doctor overseeing the death appeared in view to check on Zagorski. Zagorski was dead. The blinds into the chamber closed. Ten minutes later, the victims'' families exited the building and drove away in the van without speaking publicly. "First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don?t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I?m good," Zagorski said before he was taken from his cell to the execution chamber, according to Henry. "It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him." Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago. His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11. The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death. Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection. Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court. But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward. Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard. Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve. An unheard childhood Zagorski grew up poor in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998. His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal. He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10. He developed a stutter. He had no eye glasses for a time, despite having poor vision. At an early age, he was exposed to drugs and alcohol. MORE: Edmund Zagorski spent 34 years behind bars with little visitors Zagorski had ?minor skirmishes with the law as a juvenile and federal drug convictions as an adult,? the appeals documents show, but had no convictions for violent crime before the murders of John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter in April, 1983. If the jurors had known this, Zagorski and his team argued, it would have kept him from the death penalty. A ''calculated'' murder On April 23, Dotson was making plans with his friend Porter to meet a man he knew as Jesse Lee Hardin to buy 100 pounds of marijuana. Posing as Hardin, Zagorski told Dotson he?d worked as a mercenary in South America and worked a stint drilling for oil near New Orleans. Though not more than acquaintances, the men agreed to meet Zagorski and authorities later found their bodies in a secluded, wooded area near Interstate 65 in Robertson County. When her husband didn?t return home after the meeting, Marsha Dotson said she knew immediately something had happened. Although search efforts began right away, the bodies of Porter and Dotson weren''t found for about two weeks. There was a national manhunt for Zagorski. He was eventually spotted in Ohio and was apprehended after a shootout with police. The inmate?s statements about his time in South America could never be verified, according to Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley, who was an assistant district attorney in 1984 who tried the case and sought the death penalty. ?Whether he was or not, who knows,? the prosecutor said. ?He was apparently a very convincing person to make friends and get these people to believe enough to go out into the woods with him.? SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: The most thorough coverage starting from the moment news breaks A fight for a ''rehabilitated man'' In the 1984 trial, life without parole not an option. It''s a point Zargorski''s attorney Robert Hutton pushed in the petition to commute his sentence. The jury did not have the option to sentence him to life without parole because their only options in the 1984 trial were death or the life with the possibility of parole. Six of the surviving jurors in the case agreed life without parole was an appropriate sentence for Zagorski, the clemency request stated. Today, a death sentence would not be given if just one juror wanted life without parole And while Marsha Dotson for more than 30 years wanted nothing more than to see Zagorski put to death for his crimes, she has since "softened." ?I?ve come to realize that it?s not my place to condemn somebody, to let them die. I can?t play God," Dotson said. Hutton also argued Zaroski has also shown "exemplary" behavior during his prison term as a "rehabilitated man." He never received a single disciplinary infraction and testimonies from officers and volunteers detail his trustworthy, hardworking, respectful and peacekeeping demeanor. "His extraordinary rehabilitation demonstrates that if you commute Ed''s sentence, he will continue to make the prison community a safer place for both officers and inmates," Hutton wrote in the petition. The Roman Catholic bishops of the Nashville and Knoxville dioceses have also spoken out ahead of Zagorski''s execution. What''s next for executions in Tennessee? The debate of capital punishment has burned hot in Tennessee. Like many states, Tennessee?s death penalty law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. ?READ MORE: Knoxville attorney played role in Georgia''s elimination of electric chair Officials moved quickly to pass new laws governing the punishment in 1975. But legal challenges kept the death penalty on hold, and it wasn?t until 2000 that an execution was carried out. Six men were put to death by lethal injection and one was executed by electric chair through 2009. A hiatus followed until Irick''s execution on Aug. 9. Irick and Zagorski were part of a group of 32 death row offenders suing the state over its lethal injection method. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 majority in October the drugs can continue in Tennessee even though medical experts said the state''s controversial three-drug protocol tortures inmates to death. The state in the past has also gone back and forth on whether the electric chair should be used again. It''s unclear how Zagorski''s request for the chair will impact executions in the state moving forward but expert on executions predicts more death row inmates could follow his lead. Death row inmate David Earl Miller is set to be executed in early December. Miller, 61, was convicted of killing a disabled woman in South Knoxville with a fire poker in 1981.

		<p>The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder.</p>
<p>The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu.</p>
<p>It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class.</p>
<p>The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice.</p>
<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>
<p>?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time a justice minister has tried to execute India’s extradition request.</p>
<p>In 2014, then-justice minister Peter MacKay, after receiving assurances from India there would be no death penalty, and that consular staff could visit the two in prison, agreed to a surrender order for Badesha and Sidhu.</p>
<p>This was after B.C. Judge Gregory Fitch ruled that ?a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the respondents, enraged by the victim?s defiance of their authority, hired the Indian perpetrators to commit the murder.?</p>
<p>However, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the surrender order because Basheda’s and Sidhu’s health and safety might be endangered in an Indian jail.</p>
<p>Klein says he is pursuing two issues at the B.C. Court of Appeal on Monday. ?The fundamental question,? he said, ?is whether or not the minister’s actions (by attempting to whisk the two out of a country at the same time new evidence was submitted) amount to an abuse of process, such that a stay of proceedings has to be granted by a court as remedy.?</p>
<p>He says the second issue relates to Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Sept. 28, 2017, about the submitted new evidence, which she found wasn’t significant enough to thwart the extradition process. He wants her decision reviewed by the B.C. Appeal Court.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’s another delay in the pursuit of justice for Jassi Sidhu, and part of the tragic story of a Canadian citizen murdered in another country because of what may have been beliefs about a woman’s role in a patriarchal system.</p>
<p>Jassi Sidhu was born in Canada and grew up on a large family estate in Maple Ridge, B.C., a community about 40 kilometres from Vancouver. The head of the household was her uncle Badesha, who had left India in the 1970s and had become a wealthy blueberry farmer.</p>
<p>By the time his niece was in her early 20s and working at a local beauty salon, her uncle had arranged a marriage for her to one of his business associates, a much older man.</p>
<p>But she had already secretly married a man her own age whom she had met in India: Sukhwinder Singh Sidhu (known in court documents as ?Mithu?).</p>
<p>Her family was furious, and when she returned alone to Canada, she had to have the RCMP escort her from the family compound in Maple Ridge so she could join her husband in Punjab.</p>
<p>She told the RCMP and Punjabi police she feared for her life. ?</p>
<p>In India on June 8, 2000, she and Mithu were ambushed by a gang of men brandishing hockey sticks and a sword. Mithu was badly cut and Jassi was abducted and pushed into a car. She was found the next day on the road with her throat slit. She was 24 years old.</p>

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>

<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty.

<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you.

<p>The International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday found two people, including a former leader of Habiganj Awami League, guilty of crimes committed during the Liberation War in 1971 and sentenced them to death.</p>
<p>The convicts were awarded the punishment for their direct involvement in genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated in three upazilas -- Lakhai of Habiganj, Nasirnagar of Brahmanbaria and Astogram of Kishoreganj.</p>
<p>Liakat Ali, 63, former president of Lakhai upazila AL, and Aminul Islam alias Rajab Ali, 62, of Astogram upazila, are now on the run.</p>
<p>Liakat was a commander of local ?Razakar Bahini? and Aminul a commander of local ?Al-Badr Bahini?.

<p>?The accused are found to have had culpable and physical participation in the commission of barbaric crimes which indisputably shock the humanity,? the three-member tribunal said.</p>
<p>Tribunal Chairman Justice Md Shahinur Islam, and members Justice Amir Hossain and Justice Md Abu Ahmed Jamadar read the summary of 312-page judgment in the presence of the victims'' families, the prosecution and the defence.</p>
 CONVICTS'' IDENTITY, ROLE 
<p>A college student in 1971, Liakat, son of Khelu Mia of Lakhai, was involved with the Muslim League, along with his maternal uncle, according to case documents.</p>
<p>During the Liberation War, his uncle became the chairman of Fandauk Union Peace Committee, an anti-liberation force, in Nasirnagar upazila, while he led the union''s ?Razakar Bahini?.</p>
<p>Liakat committed the crimes with the assistance from the Pakistan army and went into hiding after the war. He later got involved in AL politics and was the president of Lakhai upazila AL from 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p>He hid again when investigations against him began in November 2014. He is believed to be in the US, according to investigators.</p>

<p>?The self-proclaimed criminal? even wrote a book titled ?Ami Al-Badr Bolchi? after his release.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Rana Dasgupta said they were satisfied with the verdict as for the first time all convicts were found guilty of all charges and handed death sentences in all seven charges.</p>

<p>With the latest verdict, the war crimes tribunals have so far delivered 35 judgments against 80 people. Fifty-four of them have been sentenced to death.</p>
 CRIMES, PUNISHMENT 
<p>The tribunal found the duo guilty of all seven charges framed against them and handed down death penalty for all charges.</p>
<p>The charges are: four acts of genocide -- killing of 43 Hindu people in Krishnapur, nine Hindu people in Chandipur, 26 Hindu people in Gadainagar and eight Hindu people in Krishnapur, Chandipur and Gadainagar of Lakhai.</p>
<p>The three charges of crimes against humanity are: killing of one Rangu Mia in Nasirnagar, five people in Sabiyanagar in Astogram, and 10 others in the same village.</p>

<p>The tribunal said in a speech in Mymensingh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on April 5 in 1972 said local perpetrators of wartime crimes would have to face trial.</p>
<p>But the ICT Act remained ineffective as no initiative was taken to form a judicial forum under this act after the assassination of Bangabandhu and his family members, it said.</p>

 ''NO ABSOLUTION FOR CRIMES''??

On July 4, 2014, a recent spate of American public massacres prompted me to post the following essay? here in Salon .?It was long before anyone was ready to blame the mayhem on more than terrorism, mental illness, the traffic in guns or demented white men. I insisted that something worse was in play, something even more dangerous than a particular strain of demagoguery that would mobilize the resentments ? of white, working-class Americans behind someone more awful than Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.</p><p>Immediately after?Salon?posted this essay, it was re-posted by the British website?openDemocracy, by?Reset?(in Rome), and by the American sites AlterNet and?History News Network. Salon''s?post was noted by the Drudge Report, website, which sent thousands of negative comments our way. The essay also provoked responses such as this ?one by conservative theologian Carl Raschke, who dubbed me an ?op-ed Jeremiah.? It prompted?this tweet from?Hendrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker:</p><p>Having thought that I was pretty much alone in wringing my hands over the imminent demise of the American republic, I was surprised by the volume and vehemence of the reactions. (I found Hertzberg''s "compliment" a bit unnerving, since I grew up six miles north of the spot where, in 1741, Edwards, the Puritan divine, delivered his own jeremiad, "Sinners in the hands of an angry God.") What surprises me now,?on re-reading the essay,?is how presciently -- I won?t say ?prophetically? -- it anticipated the severity of a republican crisis that many Americans now acknowledge but that most keep trying to normalize, deflect or minimize.</p>
    
<p>Let me say right now what the following jeremiad of 2014 makes obvious: Donald Trump isn''t?the cause of what?s plaguing us. He?s only the most prominent among many other carriers and casualties of the?disease I diagnose here.</p>
<p>In March 2016, as Trump rampaged through the Republican primaries and destroyed the party?s establishment, I undertook? a second big reckoning here in Salon ?that?prompted a 20-minute? interview ? on WNYC in New York. I''ve just finished a book that recounts how our civic implosion began 50 years ago,?even in upscale American suburbs such as Wellesley, Massachusetts. We''ll see who''s willing to risk publishing it.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>As the massacre of synagogue worshippers in Pittsburgh piles atop the massacre of white Baptist church worshippers in Texas and the massacre of a black-church study group in Charleston, atop the massacres in Las Vegas, Sandy Hook and too many other places around the country, I?ll keep right?on saying what I did here in 2014: What''s killing us is that the Supreme Court, both political parties, most?civil liberties advocates and most journalists continue to indulge the relentless, intrusive and mindless commercial "speech" of shareholder-driven corporations, including "media" companies and social media platforms, that do not deserve First Amendment protection.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>We need to re-think that protection, from the bottom up, as?I have tried to do in? The Baffler ?last summer, in the? Los Angeles Review of Books ?last week and here? in Salon ?when each of those two essays was published.?But I began it? right here , ?four years ago. I haven''t changed a word. You can fill in what''s happened since.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>*? *? *</p>
<p>By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br />
Their flag to April?s breeze unfurled,<br />
 Here once the embattled farmers stood<br />
 And fired the shot heard? ? round the world.<br />
 --Ralph Waldo Emerson, ?Concord Hymn,? 1837</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>For centuries most Americans have believed that ?the shot heard ?round the world? in 1775 from Concord, Massachusetts, heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history. Early observers of America such as G.W.F. Hegel, Edward Gibbon and Edmund Burke believed that, too. A new kind of republican citizen was rising, amid and against adherents of theocracy, divine-right monarchy, aristocracy and mercantilism. Republican citizens were quickening humanity?s stride toward horizons radiant with promises never before held and shared as widely as they were in America.</p>
                    
    
<p>The creation of the United States really was a Novus ordo seclorum, a New Order of the Ages, a society?s first self-aware, if fumbling and compromised, effort to live by the liberal expectation that autonomous individuals could govern themselves together without having to impose religious doctrines or mystical narratives of tribal blood or soil. With barely a decorous nod to The Creator, the founders of the American republic conferred on one another the right to have rights, a distinguished group of them constituting the others as ?We, the people.?</p>
<p>That revolutionary effort is not just in trouble now, or endangered, or under attack, or reinventing itself. It?s in prison, with no prospect of parole, and many Americans, including me, who wring our hands or wave our arms about this are actually among the jailers, or we?ve sleepwalked ourselves and others into the cage and have locked ourselves in. We haven?t yet understood the shots fired and heard ?round the world from 74 American schools, colleges and military bases since the Sandy Hook School massacre of December 2012.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>These shots haven?t been fired by embattled farmers at invading armies. They haven?t been fired by terrorists who?ve penetrated our surveillance and security systems. With few exceptions, they haven?t been fired by aggrieved non-white Americans.

<p>True enough, the republic thus limned by Emma Lazarus in ?The New Colossus,? her poem for the Statue o', 9997, N'Four years ago I published this essay in Salon: It predicted the rise of a demagogue, and much of what would follow Possibly nothing annoys readers of journalism more than a columnist or essayist saying, ?I told you so.? I told you so. On July 4, 2014, a recent spate of American public massacres prompted me to post the following essay?here in Salon.?It was long before anyone was ready to blame the mayhem on more than terrorism, mental illness, the traffic in guns or demented white men. I insisted that something worse was in play, something even more dangerous than a particular strain of demagoguery that would mobilize the resentments?of white, working-class Americans behind someone more awful than Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. Immediately after?Salon?posted this essay, it was re-posted by the British website?openDemocracy, by?Reset?(in Rome), and by the American sites AlterNet and?History News Network. Salon''s?post was noted by the Drudge Report, website, which sent thousands of negative comments our way. The essay also provoked responses such as this?one by conservative theologian Carl Raschke, who dubbed me an ?op-ed Jeremiah.? It prompted?this tweet from?Hendrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker: Having thought that I was pretty much alone in wringing my hands over the imminent demise of the American republic, I was surprised by the volume and vehemence of the reactions. (I found Hertzberg''s "compliment" a bit unnerving, since I grew up six miles north of the spot where, in 1741, Edwards, the Puritan divine, delivered his own jeremiad, "Sinners in the hands of an angry God.") What surprises me now,?on re-reading the essay,?is how presciently -- I won?t say ?prophetically? -- it anticipated the severity of a republican crisis that many Americans now acknowledge but that most keep trying to normalize, deflect or minimize. Let me say right now what the following jeremiad of 2014 makes obvious: Donald Trump isn''t?the cause of what?s plaguing us. He?s only the most prominent among many other carriers and casualties of the?disease I diagnose here. In March 2016, as Trump rampaged through the Republican primaries and destroyed the party?s establishment, I undertook?a second big reckoning here in Salon?that?prompted a 20-minute?interview?on WNYC in New York. I''ve just finished a book that recounts how our civic implosion began 50 years ago,?even in upscale American suburbs such as Wellesley, Massachusetts. We''ll see who''s willing to risk publishing it. As the massacre of synagogue worshippers in Pittsburgh piles atop the massacre of white Baptist church worshippers in Texas and the massacre of a black-church study group in Charleston, atop the massacres in Las Vegas, Sandy Hook and too many other places around the country, I?ll keep right?on saying what I did here in 2014: What''s killing us is that the Supreme Court, both political parties, most?civil liberties advocates and most journalists continue to indulge the relentless, intrusive and mindless commercial "speech" of shareholder-driven corporations, including "media" companies and social media platforms, that do not deserve First Amendment protection. We need to re-think that protection, from the bottom up, as?I have tried to do in?The Baffler?last summer, in the?Los Angeles Review of Books?last week and here?in Salon?when each of those two essays was published.?But I began it?right here,?four years ago. I haven''t changed a word. You can fill in what''s happened since. *? *? * By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April?s breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard??round the world. --Ralph Waldo Emerson, ?Concord Hymn,? 1837 For centuries most Americans have believed that ?the shot heard ?round the world? in 1775 from Concord, Massachusetts, heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history. Early observers of America such as G.W.F. Hegel, Edward Gibbon and Edmund Burke believed that, too. A new kind of republican citizen was rising, amid and against adherents of theocracy, divine-right monarchy, aristocracy and mercantilism. Republican citizens were quickening humanity?s stride toward horizons radiant with promises never before held and shared as widely as they were in America. The creation of the United States really was a Novus ordo seclorum, a New Order of the Ages, a society?s first self-aware, if fumbling and compromised, effort to live by the liberal expectation that autonomous individuals could govern themselves together without having to impose religious doctrines or mystical narratives of tribal blood or soil. With barely a decorous nod to The Creator, the founders of the American republic conferred on one another the right to have rights, a distinguished group of them constituting the others as ?We, the people.? That revolutionary effort is not just in trouble now, or endangered, or under attack, or reinventing itself. It?s in prison, with no prospect of parole, and many Americans, including me, who wring our hands or wave our arms about this are actually among the jailers, or we?ve sleepwalked ourselves and others into the cage and have locked ourselves in. We haven?t yet understood the shots fired and heard ?round the world from 74 American schools, colleges and military bases since the Sandy Hook School massacre of December 2012. These shots haven?t been fired by embattled farmers at invading armies. They haven?t been fired by terrorists who?ve penetrated our surveillance and security systems. With few exceptions, they haven?t been fired by aggrieved non-white Americans. They?ve been fired mostly by young, white American citizens at other white citizens, and by American soldiers at other American soldiers, inside the very institutions where republican virtues and beliefs are nurtured and defended. They?ve been fired from within a body politic so drained of candor and trust that, beneath our continuing lip-service to republican premises and practices, we?ve let a court conflate the free speech of flesh-and-blood citizens with the disembodied wealth of anonymous shareholders. And we?ve let lawmakers, bought or intimidated by gun peddlers and zealots, render us helpless against torrents of marketed fear and vengeance that are dissolving a distinctively American democratic ethos the literary historian?Daniel Aaron?characterized as ?ethical and pragmatic, disciplined and free.? Many Americans are adapting to living with variants of force and fraud that erupt in road rage; lethal stampedes by shoppers on sale days; security precautions in their homes against the prospect of armed invasion; gladiatorialization and corruption in sports; nihilism in entertainment that fetishizes violence without context and sex without attachment ; the casino-like financing of utterly unproductive economic activities such as the entertainment I''ve just mentioned and the predatory lending that has tricked millions out of their homes; the commercial groping and goosing of private lives and public spaces, even in the marketing of ordinary consumer goods; and the huge, new prison industry that Americans have created to deter or punish broken, violent men, most of them non-white, only to find schools in even the whitest, ?safest? neighborhoods imprisoned by fear of white gunmen who?ve often been students themselves. Abroad, meanwhile, thousands more shots, fiendish and celebratory, are being fired into the corpses of American national-security and nation-building projects by terrorists and fanatics we were told had been decimated. These projects cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, limbs, homes and hopes, including those of American soldiers, contractors and idealists. Their sacrifices can?t justify retroactively what shouldn?t have been undertaken in the first place. Stressed by all this republican derangement, millions are spending billions on palliatives, medications, addictions and even surveillance designed to protect them from themselves. All those vials, syringes, security systems and shootings reflect the insinuation of what Gibbon called ?a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire?? until Roman citizens ?no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.? Only a few late-Roman republicans, recalling their old freedoms, concluded, with Livy, that ?We have become too ill to bear our sickness or their cures.? What went wrong? You might argue, and quite rightly, that ?We, the people? have always subverted the truths we?d held to be self-evident, beginning with slavery and continuing with plutocracy. Yet somehow the republic kept experiencing what Lincoln called ?a new birth of freedom," thanks only partly to the fortuitous confluence of two oceans? protection, a vast continent?s ever-alluring frontier and unending streams of aspiring immigrants: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame With conquering limbs astride from land to land, Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates will stand A mighty woman with a torch Whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, And her name: Mother of Exiles True enough, the republic thus limned by Emma Lazarus in ?The New Colossus,? her poem for the Statue of Liberty, needed those exiles for its labor market. And it still had a guiding aristocracy of sorts, but supposedly only "an aristocracy of talent and virtue," as Jefferson put it, and not one of blood and ill-gotten wealth.?True, too, certain lingering Puritan beliefs had nourished in the embattled farmers (and, even long before 1775, in some of the Puritans themselves) a conviction that resistance to tyranny is obedience to God. That injunction to defy worldly power sometimes in the name of a Higher Power legitimated individual conscience and autonomy right up through the nonviolent defiance of the best of the civil-rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. But the American emphasis on individual conscience and autonomy also gestated a liberal capitalist republic that has reduced individualism to market exchanges in ways that are now destroying both individuals and the society. A liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily certain public virtues and beliefs that neither the liberal state nor markets can nourish or defend. The liberal state isn?t supposed to judge between one way of life and another, after all; and markets reward you as a self-interested consumer and investor, not as a citizen who might put such interests aside at times to advance a greater good that self-interest alone can''t achieve. The moral silence and often bankruptcy of states and markets leaves citizen-leaders to be nourished and trained all the more intensively in institutions that stand somewhat apart from the state and markets. The Puritan founders of America?s oldest colleges understood this, but they expected that those colleges'' graduates would serve a theocratic state that would control markets and everything else.?We?re right to dismiss the Puritans? theocracy because it was repressive and hypocritical. But we''re wrong to have lost a side of its animating spirit that would have kept markets from controlling and devouring republican government and even our bodies and ourselves. Symptoms and scapegoats hide the disease Having miscarried republican self-discipline and conviction so badly, we find ourselves scrambling to monitor, measure and control the consequences, such as the proliferation of mental illness and the glorification and marketing of guns, as if these were causing our implosion. They aren?t. They?re symptoms, not causes -- reactions to widespread heartbreak at the breakdown of what Tocqueville called republican habits of the heart that we used to cultivate. Equally symptomatic, not causal, are self-avowedly ?deviant? and ?transgressive? gyrations by people who imagine that the sunset of civic-republican order heralds a liberating, Dionysian dawn. Sloughing off our bad old repressions, we?ve been swept up by the swift market currents that turn countercultures into over-the-counter cultures and promote a free-for-all that?s a free-for-none as citizens become customers chasing ?freedoms? for sale. Even our war-makers? and -mongers? grand strategies and the growing militarization of our domestic police forces are more symptomatic than causal of the public derangement that''s rising all around us. But turning the bearers of such frightening symptoms into our primary villains or scapegoats would only deepen our blindness to the disease, which is as old as the biblical worship of the Golden Calf and as new as Goldman Sachs. It runs deeper than anything that anyone but the Puritans and their Old Testament models tried to tackle. I''m not suggesting we can or should return to Puritanism! Anyone expecting to recover that faith and way of life is stumbling up dry streambeds toward wellsprings that have themselves run dry. But we do need wellsprings that could fortify us to take risks even more daunting than those taken by the embattled farmers. We''d somehow have to reconfigure or abandon empty comforts, escapes and protections that both free-market conservatives and readers of Salon are accustomed to buying and selling, sometimes against our own best hopes and convictions. Our cure would also require reweaving a fabric of public candor and comity strong enough to resist the rise of?ressentiment, a public psychopathology, once associated with the rise of fascism, in which insecurities, envy and hatreds that many have been nursing in private converge in scary public eruptions that diminish their participants even in seeming to make them big.?Ressentiment?s??little-big man? seeks easy targets for frustrations borne of exploitation by powers that he''s afraid to face and reckon with head-on. Blaming scapegoats warps his assessment of his hardships and options and drives him to wreak vengeance on them as soon as there are enough little-big men (and women, of course) to do so?en masse?under a Glenn Beck or a Sarah Palin. Whether?ressentiment?erupts in racist violence, sectarian fanaticism, anti-Communist witch hunts, totalitarian show trials, politically correct cultural revolutions or sadistic escapism, its most telling symptoms are paranoia and routinized bursts of hysteria. Under the ministrations of gifted demagogues, its grievances and pain assume a fleeting brilliance that soon collapses, tragi-comically or catastrophically, on its own cowardice and lies. Its targets often shift. The 9/11 attacks brought a reprieve of sorts to African-Americans, the republic?s most enduring scapegoats, when the burden of white censure pivoted toward Muslims. Louis Farrakhan?s Nation of Islam lost credibility, but so did whites such as the neoconservative Daniel Pipes, who kept on insisting years after 9/11 that the first black president was a Muslim and a friend of terrorists. The slipperiness of scapegoating became clear to me in 1993, as I?wrote?about a deranged black gunman, Colin Ferguson, who?d opened fire in a Long Island Rail Road car, killing six passengers. Even while holding him responsible, I saw him bearing symptoms far more widespread than his private demons. Noting Ferguson?s enthusiasm for a politics of rage, paranoia and death threats then prominent on a black radio station and in demagogic street politics, I warned that even deranged loners are sometimes better attuned to our subconscious hatreds and fears than we care to admit.?That was true, too, of?Jared Loughner,?the white paranoid-schizophrenic and anti-government fantasist who killed a U.S. District Court judge and six other people while trying to kill but severely wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 13 others in 2011. While apocalyptic religious and racist ranting can provoke emotionally disturbed people, so can journalism and entertainment that massage hatreds too diffuse to be called racist, religious or ideological. Some school shooters nursed the depictions of violence and lust that are?pumped incessantly?into young Americans? horizons with the help of new technologies and investment strategies that ride reckless misreadings of the First Amendment.?This hasn?t been done with malevolent intent as often as it?s been done in a kind of civic mindlessness by media corporations incentivized and indeed forced by market pressures to bypass our brains and hearts on the way to our lower viscera and wallets by exaggerating fears of armed home invasion, government takeover and vengeful victory by gunplay. The invisible disease Even though relatively few young Americans follow these siren songs into acts of destruction, the public fetishizing of sex and violence without context or caring dampens many others? faith in society during their formative years. You don?t need to know a lot of developmental psychology or anthropology to know that children crave culturally coherent tests of prowess and loyalty in symbolic rites of passage that ratify their communal belonging. When such rites and symbols fail, some flail about, seeking order in private delusions, Dartmouth College fraternities and public orchestrations of?ressentiment. In 1775, most American communities still filtered such basic generational and human needs through traditions that encompassed kinship bonds and seasonal rhythms. In "Common Sense," Thomas Paine could urge readers to take their recent experiences of monarchy ?to the touchstones of nature? and decide whether they would abide the empire''s abuses.?Today, those "touchstones of nature" -- and with them, republican convictions about selfhood and society -- have been torn up by runaway engines and developments in technology, communications and even intimate biology that would terrify Paine, Adam Smith and John Locke, not to mention those who fired the first shot at Concord. This time, we''re all in bed with the enemy. In "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" 40 years ago, Daniel Bell -- no anti-capitalist, but prophetic enough about the worship of Golden Calves -- argued that free markets no longer make free men because "economic liberalism has become? corporate oligopoly, and, in the pursuit of private wants, a hedonism that is destructive of social needs." He warned that consumer capitalism displaces the needs that the early republic filtered through nature?s rhythms and kinship traditions. It displaces those needs with ginned-up ?wants? that ?by their nature, are unlimited and insatiable?. [T]he rational calculation of efficiency and return? displace ?the principle of the public household," strip-mining and selling off fragments of cultural narratives. Without civic wellsprings and narratives deep and compelling enough to strengthen a society?s adhesives and disciplines in the hearts of its young, neither free-market conservatives nor world-is-flat neoliberal cosmopolitans can reconcile their professed commitments to ordered, republican liberty with their knee-jerk obedience to riptides of destructive investment that are dissolving republican virtue and sovereignty before our eyes. No wonder we?re losing our vision, in both senses of the word: Our foreign-policy savants across the ideological spectrum were too blind to see that the Soviet Union was so much weaker than American Cold War propaganda and hysteria insisted that it imploded in 1989. The fabled "missile gap" that John F. Kennedy ran on in 1960 was as imaginary as Saddam Hussein''s WMD, but anyone who tried telling either of those truths was charged with a ?failure of nerve? or worse by the blind warmongers in our midst. Our business press was too blind to see that a tsunami of predatory lending would wreck the national economy and throw millions from their homes. Our market-addled congressional committees and blue-ribbon commissions on national intelligence couldn?t discover, until Edward Snowden revealed it, that public surveillance had taken on an all-devouring life of its own. Neoconservative and Vulcan conservative advocates of using American military force to spread democracy abroad couldn?t see that their strategy was doomed because democracy isn''t woven that way and because it was destroying democracy at home in ways that, if unchecked, will destroy the republic whose strengths they''ve so badly misconstrued and betrayed. Our consumer society, addicted to cheap comforts and quick fixes, can''t see its own Orwellian ensnarement by commercial censors, and it couldn?t take Al Gore?s "Inconvenient Truth? about global warming seriously enough to offset the onrushing damage with the serious sacrifices we have yet to make. Our gilded political consultants, pollsters and campaign donors were too blind to see the boiling undercurrents that have swept away House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Nor can they see that Cantor?s political demise presages an inflammation of?ressentiment?so wild that the coming, specious, ?Who Lost Iraq?? debate will be accompanied by the shot that some military veteran who feels betrayed will fire at a politician who?s been left holding the empty bag of our civic-republican hopes. So we are flying almost totally blind, punched bloody by a Hand that we keep insisting is Invisible. We can see only the sickness of the gunmen and of the proliferation of their guns. Treatment of those symptoms is urgently needed, but it will be insufficient to curb the wrecking ball that global capitalism has become on our willfully blind watch, and triage won''t renew the civic fabric. Exemplary defiance has its place Whenever republican candor and courage have seemed about to succumb like this to tribal and theocratic delusions or to force and fraud in the past, some citizens have roused others to fend off threats to republican premises and practices: In 1776 a young schoolteacher named Nathan Hale was caught trying to track and expose the military and intelligence operations of the only established, legitimate government of his time. But just before his hanging he said, ?I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country? and became an incarnation of a nascent republic. Hale''s dignity in adversity, unfathomable to many of us these days, anticipated that of Martin Luther King Jr. and the black churchgoers who walked unarmed and trembling toward armed men and dogs with nothing but their faith and their long-shot strategy to delegitimate the seemingly impregnable segregationist establishment of their time by appealing to republican principles and an American civil religion whose theology was as vague as that of the founders. Hale?s dignity also anticipated that of three Yale seniors I came upon one wintry morning in 1968 as they gave university chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. their military draft cards to announce their resistance to the U.S. government on behalf of the American republic. ?The government says we?re criminals, but we say the government is criminal for waging this war,? said one of the seniors, struggling to find his voice. For all we knew, these guys were about to be arrested on the spot, and some of us felt arrested morally by their example because they were ready to pay the penalty of law in order to affirm their commitment to honest law itself. Coffin, who held to a Calvinist theology that, like King?s, saw resistance to tyranny as obedience to God, was present to bless a courage that few national-security state conservatives understand, in the idiom of an American civil religion few neoliberals and postmodern leftists understand. When he quoted Dylan Thomas? ?Do not go gentle into that good night; rage, rage, against the dying of the light,? that civil religion seemed to awaken briefly and to walk and talk again, re-moralizing the state and the law, and the silent, wild confusion I was feeling gave way to something like awe. (I described this experience?in The Washington Monthly in 2000, during the protracted ?election? of George W. Bush.) Hale?s courage also anticipated Edward Snowden?s. Both young men may have been impetuous and otherwise flawed in some respects, but they showed that resistance to corrupted power requires not only prowess, means, and will, but an elusive, republican sensibility that?s cultivated in civil society and confirmed in little daily interactions long before it emerges in demonstrations of civic courage that startle and move other citizens. With a wonderment somewhat like Hegel?s, the German political philosopher J?rgen Habermas marveled at this ?constitutional patriotism? in American citizens who possessed what Gibbon described as ?that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honor, the presence of danger, and the habit of command.? When I tell young millennials these stories, though, many of them listen pretty much as they would to tales about knights in shining armor, long ago and far away. Much closer to them are the school shootings and internet mayhem that make brave citizenship seem archaic, implausible and irrelevant to self-discovery and social change. Yet republican expectations do have ways of resurfacing whenever ?We, the people? begin to imagine what our lives would be like, singly and together, if we had to live without them. Not everyone can be seduced or intimidated away from them. Still, so many Americans are generations removed from any easily recoverable religious or ethno-racial identity or other adhesive that we have to ask: Where are the touchstones or narratives strong enough renew public virtues and beliefs that neither markets nor the liberal state do much to nourish or defend? Nourishing a new liberal order The question should prompt a quest for a political culture that isn?t too commercial and vapid and that isn''t held together only by demagoguery and delusion. No reconfiguration of today?s capitalism will be possible without something better than that. Yet no think tank, legislature or foundation can carry that quest or that reconfiguration to a just conclusion. Nor can an Occupy Wall Street that isn?t grounded in something deeper than its own noble effort to?be?the change it wants us all to make. Nor can our ?illness? be cured by champions of a new foreign-policy??realism? such as Robert Kagan, who?urge us to face the inevitable challenges?of a world where only willpower and force can sustain the liberal order that many Americans take for granted. That?s right as far as it goes,?but it begs the question of where willpower comes from and what, within the liberal order itself, is sapping that willpower. Quoting Michael Ignatieff, Kagan speculates candidly that liberal civilization itself ?runs deeply against the human grain and is achieved and sustained only by the most unremitting struggle against human nature.? Perhaps, Kagan adds, ?this fragile democratic garden requires the protection of a liberal world order, with constant feeding, watering, weeding, and the fencing off of an ever-encroaching jungle.? But he can?t seem to face the challenge posed by the new shots heard ?round the world from America: The jungle and its encroachments begin not only abroad but within our own garden. What seems our greatest weakness could be one of our greatest strengths, although it, too, won''t be enough: Even 150 years after the founding, the philosopher George Santayana?wrote?that Americans still heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history precisely because they?d ?all been uprooted from their several soils and ancestries and plunged together into one vortex, whirling irresistible in a space otherwise quite empty. To be an American is of itself almost a moral condition, an education and a career?.? Although there?s plenty to regret and respect in the traditions we?ve lost, there?s no turning back from the ?moral condition? and ?career? we face as citizens. We have no choice but to keep faith with the republic and one another. If Americans have a manifest destiny now, it?s to lead in weaving a new republican fabric that markets can serve but not subvert. In 2008, Barack Obama seemed to incarnate so brilliantly the promise of weaving our diversity into a new republican discipline -- he even invoked Puritan and biblical wellsprings in some of his speeches -- that many people ?round the world considered him a prophet who would satisfy their hunger for new narratives. Probably no national political leader ever can do that. The narratives the world needs now will have to come from other prophets and leaders yet unsung. I do think that Americans will be strong among them, if only because we?ve had so much experience generating that hunger by generating the civic-republican-capitalist effort that has failed.', 28851, N'no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the ...', N'Our republic is in crisis — and it’s killing us.

And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

The Bonner County Daily Bee reports that 21-year-old Jacob Corban Coleman pleaded guilty Friday. Prosecutors dropped their pursuit of the death penalty as part of the plea deal. Police say Coleman in August 2017 called a cab and 22-year-old Gagandeep Singh of Spokane picked him up at Spokane International Airport. Authorities say Coleman told police he became homicidal and bought a knife during a stop at a store. Singh stopped in Kootenai, Idaho, when it became clear Coleman didn''t have a destination. Police say Coleman then stabbed Singh, who died at the scene. A two-day sentencing hearing for Coleman is scheduled for Jan. 3. ___ Information from: Bonner County (Idaho) Daily Bee, http://www.bonnercountydailybee.com (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Eight people believed to be family members of the victims entered the prison to witness the execution. They waited in front of a covered large window that looked into the execution chamber where on the other side of the glass Zagorski sat pinned in the electric chair, held down by buckles and straps with electrodes fastened to his feet. The blinds opened for the rest of the witnesses to see Zagorski dressed in his cotton clothes, smiling and grimacing to the group. Zagorski pronounced his last words: "Let?s Rock."

"It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him." Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago. His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11. The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death. Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection. Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court. But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward. Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard. Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve. An unheard childhood Zagorski grew up poor in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998. His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal. He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10. He developed a stutter. He had no eye glasses for a time, despite having poor vision. At an early age, he was exposed to drugs and alcohol. MORE: Edmund Zagorski spent 34 years behind bars with little visitors Zagorski had ?minor skirmishes with the law as a juvenile and federal drug convictions as an adult,? the appeals documents show, but had no convictions for violent crime before the murders of John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter in April, 1983. If the jurors had known this, Zagorski and his team argued, it would have kept him from the death penalty. A ''calculated'' murder On April 23, Dotson was making plans with his friend Porter to meet a man he knew as Jesse Lee Hardin to buy 100 pounds of marijuana. Posing as Hardin, Zagorski told Dotson he?d worked as a mercenary in South America and worked a stint drilling for oil near New Orleans. Though not more than acquaintances, the men agreed to meet Zagorski and authorities later found their bodies in a secluded, wooded area near Interstate 65 in Robertson County. When her husband didn?t return home after the meeting, Marsha Dotson said she knew immediately something had happened. Although search efforts began right away, the bodies of Porter and Dotson weren''t found for about two weeks. There was a national manhunt for Zagorski. He was eventually spotted in Ohio and was apprehended after a shootout with police. The inmate?s statements about his time in South America could never be verified, according to Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley, who was an assistant district attorney in 1984 who tried the case and sought the death penalty. ?Whether he was or not, who knows,? the prosecutor said. ?He was apparently a very convincing person to make friends and get these people to believe enough to go out into the woods with him.? SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: The most thorough coverage starting from the moment news breaks A fight for a ''rehabilitated man'' In the 1984 trial, life without parole not an option. It''s a point Zargorski''s attorney Robert Hutton pushed in the petition to commute his sentence. The jury did not have the option to sentence him to life without parole because their only options in the 1984 trial were death or the life with the possibility of parole. Six of the surviving jurors in the case agreed life without parole was an appropriate sentence for Zagorski, the clemency request stated. Today, a death sentence would not be given if just one juror wanted life without parole And while Marsha Dotson for more than 30 years wanted nothing more than to see Zagorski put to death for his crimes, she has since "softened." ?I?ve come to realize that it?s not my place to condemn somebody, to let them die. I can?t play God," Dotson said. Hutton also argued Zaroski has also shown "exemplary" behavior during his prison term as a "rehabilitated man." He never received a single disciplinary infraction and testimonies from officers and volunteers detail his trustworthy, hardworking, respectful and peacekeeping demeanor. "His extraordinary rehabilitation demonstrates that if you commute Ed''s sentence, he will continue to make the prison community a safer place for both officers and inmates," Hutton wrote in the petition. The Roman Catholic bishops of the Nashville and Knoxville dioceses have also spoken out ahead of Zagorski''s execution. What''s next for executions in Tennessee? The debate of capital punishment has burned hot in Tennessee. Like many states, Tennessee?s death penalty law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. ?READ MORE: Knoxville attorney played role in Georgia''s elimination of electric chair Officials moved quickly to pass new laws governing the punishment in 1975. But legal challenges kept the death penalty on hold, and it wasn?t until 2000 that an execution was carried out. Six men were put to death by lethal injection and one was executed by electric chair through 2009. A hiatus followed until Irick''s execution on Aug. 9. Irick and Zagorski were part of a group of 32 death row offenders suing the state over its lethal injection method. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 majority in October the drugs can continue in Tennessee even though medical experts said the state''s controversial three-drug protocol tortures inmates to death. The state in the past has also gone back and forth on whether the electric chair should be used again. It''s unclear how Zagorski''s request for the chair will impact executions in the state moving forward but expert on executions predicts more death row inmates could follow his lead. Death row inmate David Earl Miller is set to be executed in early December. Miller, 61, was convicted of killing a disabled woman in South Knoxville with a fire poker in 1981. He is the longest current member of Tennessee''s death row.

Freddie Woodruff, the CIA branch chief in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, was shot in the head and killed. He had been traveling in the car with Eldar Gogoladze, the bodyguard of the former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then part of a four-man governing council that ruled the newly independent Georgia.</p><p>Accompanying Woodruff and Gogoladze were two Georgian women, one of whom turned out to be a Russian military spy and mafia assassin.</p><p>Woodruff had arrived in the country in early June of 1993?to help train the country?s security forces. It was the first such mission in the former Soviet Union.</p><p>Georgia was a lawless nation at the time. Several years earlier, the country had emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and was still overrun with Russian intelligence agents. Crime was rampant and electricity sporadic as rival gangs and paramilitaries competed for influence. Georgia was fighting a separatist insurgency in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. The CIA had also identified the country as a major drug smuggling route.</p><p>After Woodruff was shot and killed, then-CIA director James Woolsey traveled to Georgia personally to claim the dead?body. Georgian officials determined that the murder?had been an accident and Woodruff had been killed by a stray bullet shot by a drunken soldier who was unaware that there was an American in the car. A trial was held in 1994?and a young man named Anzor Sharmaidze was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for the murder.</p><p>But Texas lawyer Michael Pullara was not convinced by this explanation. Pullara, a family friend of the Woodruffs who had gone to school with Freddie Woodruff?s sister, was motivated to get to the bottom of the murder. After carefully analyzing the evidence presented during Sharmaidze?s trial in Georgia and issuing numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FBI and CIA, Woodruff became convinced that Sharmaidze was innocent and that Russia was behind the assassination of the CIA agent.</p><p>In his new book T he Spy Who Was Left Behind , Pullara describes in vivid detail his investigation, which spanned decades and borders, and how he linked Woodruff?s murder to Russia?s Special Forces and to veteran CIA agent Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union just months after Woodruff was killed.?</p><p>Pullara succeeded in having Sharmaidze released from prison in 2008.

I made my first FOIA request in 1994 and I made my first trip to Georgia in 2004. I got Anzor out of prison in 2008. And I was still making trips and trying to reverse the conviction until 2013. I would say, in terms of actively pursuing the case, 2004 to 2009 was the most active period.</p><p>It never occurred to me to write a book until at one point in the process the State Department accused me of doing the whole project as a publicity stunt in order to write a book. I guess I have them to thank.</p><p>After Anzor was released from prison he called me and asked me for money. One of my solutions for getting him money was buying his?rights to the book. I paid him upfront. I bought the rights up front in cash, and I will give him some of the proceeds from the book. I wanted him to feel like he was getting fair value for selling his experience.</p><p> <img itemprop="contentUrl" width="594" height="387" class="mapping-embed lazysize lazyload" src="https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/11/02/gettyimages-51503136-594x594.jpg" alt="gettyimages-51503136-594x594" title="" />  Former senior Central Intelligence Agency officer Aldrich Hazen Ames is led from U.S. Federal Courthouse in Alexandria on February 22, 1994, after being arraigned on charges of spying for the former Soviet Union.   Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images   </p><p>If Aldrich Ames was to blame for the murder, why do you think the CIA would want to cover that up? Would it not be easier to pin the murder on a traitor, someone who had spied for the Soviet Union?</p><p>I have my suspicions and conclusions about that. First, I have nothing but enormous respect for the professionals at the [CIA] agency and the [FBI] bureau. The closer I got to their work the more astounded I was at their excellence and expertise.</p><p>Both the agency the bureau already knew that Ames was a spy at the time that they let him go to Georgia. The decision to let people go to Tbilisi in 1993 was part of the Ames investigation. They had already searched his home and office, had already installed audio and video surveillance, and were already following him 24 hours a day.</p><p>The CIA had already briefed [former national security adviser] Tony Lake and Lake had already briefed [former President] Bill Clinton. The DOJ had already opened a criminal case against Ames for espionage. The investigation of Ames was largely complete.?</p><p>They were allowing [Ames] to continue to be free because they had more losses than could be explained by Aldrich Ames alone, and I believe they made the calculated decision to let him go free and see if he led them to another spy.</p><p>So they let this unwitting CIA officer, Woodruff, be exposed to Ames.

He had been traveling in the car with Eldar Gogoladze, the bodyguard of the former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then part of a four-man governing council that ruled the newly independent Georgia. Accompanying Woodruff and Gogoladze were two Georgian women, one of whom turned out to be a Russian military spy and mafia assassin. Woodruff had arrived in the country in early June of 1993?to help train the country?s security forces. It was the first such mission in the former Soviet Union. Georgia was a lawless nation at the time. Several years earlier, the country had emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and was still overrun with Russian intelligence agents. Crime was rampant and electricity sporadic as rival gangs and paramilitaries competed for influence. Georgia was fighting a separatist insurgency in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. The CIA had also identified the country as a major drug smuggling route. After Woodruff was shot and killed, then-CIA director James Woolsey traveled to Georgia personally to claim the dead?body. Georgian officials determined that the murder?had been an accident and Woodruff had been killed by a stray bullet shot by a drunken soldier who was unaware that there was an American in the car. A trial was held in 1994?and a young man named Anzor Sharmaidze was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for the murder. But Texas lawyer Michael Pullara was not convinced by this explanation. Pullara, a family friend of the Woodruffs who had gone to school with Freddie Woodruff?s sister, was motivated to get to the bottom of the murder. After carefully analyzing the evidence presented during Sharmaidze?s trial in Georgia and issuing numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FBI and CIA, Woodruff became convinced that Sharmaidze was innocent and that Russia was behind the assassination of the CIA agent. In his new book The Spy Who Was Left Behind, Pullara describes in vivid detail his investigation, which spanned decades and borders, and how he linked Woodruff?s murder to Russia?s Special Forces and to veteran CIA agent Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union just months after Woodruff was killed.? Pullara succeeded in having Sharmaidze released from prison in 2008. In 2013, Georgia?s justice minister Tea Tsulukiani said she believes the case ?had not been properly investigated." In a conversation with Newsweek, Pullara describes his hopes for the new book and why he believes it took so long for the truth about Woodruff?s death to be discovered. How long did this investigation take? I started in 1993, literally the day after the murder was presented in The New York Times. I made my first FOIA request in 1994 and I made my first trip to Georgia in 2004. I got Anzor out of prison in 2008. And I was still making trips and trying to reverse the conviction until 2013. I would say, in terms of actively pursuing the case, 2004 to 2009 was the most active period. It never occurred to me to write a book until at one point in the process the State Department accused me of doing the whole project as a publicity stunt in order to write a book. I guess I have them to thank. After Anzor was released from prison he called me and asked me for money. One of my solutions for getting him money was buying his?rights to the book. I paid him upfront. I bought the rights up front in cash, and I will give him some of the proceeds from the book. I wanted him to feel like he was getting fair value for selling his experience. Former senior Central Intelligence Agency officer Aldrich Hazen Ames is led from U.S. Federal Courthouse in Alexandria on February 22, 1994, after being arraigned on charges of spying for the former Soviet Union. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images If Aldrich Ames was to blame for the murder, why do you think the CIA would want to cover that up? Would it not be easier to pin the murder on a traitor, someone who had spied for the Soviet Union? I have my suspicions and conclusions about that. First, I have nothing but enormous respect for the professionals at the [CIA] agency and the [FBI] bureau. The closer I got to their work the more astounded I was at their excellence and expertise. Both the agency the bureau already knew that Ames was a spy at the time that they let him go to Georgia. The decision to let people go to Tbilisi in 1993 was part of the Ames investigation. They had already searched his home and office, had already installed audio and video surveillance, and were already following him 24 hours a day. The CIA had already briefed [former national security adviser] Tony Lake and Lake had already briefed [former President] Bill Clinton. The DOJ had already opened a criminal case against Ames for espionage. The investigation of Ames was largely complete.? They were allowing [Ames] to continue to be free because they had more losses than could be explained by Aldrich Ames alone, and I believe they made the calculated decision to let him go free and see if he led them to another spy. So they let this unwitting CIA officer, Woodruff, be exposed to Ames. It was generally reported that Ames and Woodruff had an angry confrontation in Tbilisi. While he was in Tbilisi, Ames and Woodruff spent a ton of time together: a day driving to the Russian border and a night getting drunk. After that night with Ames, Woodruff was morose and visibly distracted. And he was later observed having an angry confrontation with Ames at a Tbilisi bar. No one knows exactly why they argued, but the context suggests that on their night out Ames had gotten drunk and said something that made Woodruff suspicious. But if?the agency knows that Ames is a spy and they know there was a confrontation, and?they aren?t protecting Woodruff from what he may have found out, I think there is responsibility there that they are trying to deal with.? The agency had trained Woodruff to be suspicious but did not protect him from the possibility that his suspicion might fall on Ames. The agency had intentionally exposed Woodruff to a known traitor without a plan to protect him if he somehow uncovered evidence of Ames?s treachery. I think this was an error in judgment that contributed to Woodruff?s death and to the agency?s decision to cover up the murder. If the FBI had been permitted to perform a thorough investigation, the evidence would certainly have led back to Ames and, in short order, to the suspect decision by the bureau and the agency to allow Ames to travel to the former Soviet Union. But by waiting to arrest Ames until after a patsy had been convicted of the murder, the men and women who had made that suspect decision distracted the public and avoided all accountability for their part in Woodruff?s death. Ames would have known that he had committed a serious indiscretion by revealing himself to Woodruff. His only recourse was to contact his Russian handlers immediately and obtain either asylum or assistance. This would have been easy to do because Ames wasn?t being followed in Georgia and because there were lots of KGB and GRU agents in Tbilisi. But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he left the country. You see, the Russians knew CIA culture and they knew that Woodruff would wait to report his suspicions until he got back to headquarters in Langley, Virginia. This meant the Russians had a two-week window in which to assassinate him. When Ames was finally arrested in February 1994?? a week after Anzor Sharmaidze was convicted of killing Woodruff?? the FBI began immediately to investigate whether there was a connection between Ames and the Woodruff murder. However, they were frustrated in pursuing that investigation. The arrest of Ames had created a new imperative?? that the traitor not be accused?of murdering an American. He could kill a bunch of Russians and still go to prison for life. But if he caused the death of a CIA colleague then it would be very hard for him to avoid the death penalty. And the CIA needed Ames alive so they could debrief him over the next 30 years, a process known as "walking the cat backwards." The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder. So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>

<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity.

<p>By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br />
Their flag to April?s breeze unfurled,<br />
 Here once the embattled farmers stood<br />
 And fired the shot heard? ? round the world.<br />
 --Ralph Waldo Emerson, ?Concord Hymn,? 1837</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>For centuries most Americans have believed that ?the shot heard ?round the world? in 1775 from Concord, Massachusetts, heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history. Early observers of America such as G.W.F. Hegel, Edward Gibbon and Edmund Burke believed that, too. A new kind of republican citizen was rising, amid and against adherents of theocracy, divine-right monarchy, aristocracy and mercantilism. Republican citizens were quickening humanity?s stride toward horizons radiant with promises never before held and shared as widely as they were in America.</p>
                    
    
<p>The creation of the United States really was a Novus ordo seclorum, a New Order of the Ages, a society?s first self-aware, if fumbling and compromised, effort to live by the liberal expectation that autonomous individuals could govern themselves together without having to impose religious doctrines or mystical narratives of tribal blood or soil. With barely a decorous nod to The Creator, the founders of the American republic conferred on one another the right to have rights, a distinguished group of them constituting the others as ?We, the people.?</p>
<p>That revolutionary effort is not just in trouble now, or endangered, or under attack, or reinventing itself. It?s in prison, with no prospect of parole, and many Americans, including me, who wring our hands or wave our arms about this are actually among the jailers, or we?ve sleepwalked ourselves and others into the cage and have locked ourselves in. We haven?t yet understood the shots fired and heard ?round the world from 74 American schools, colleges and military bases since the Sandy Hook School massacre of December 2012.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>These shots haven?t been fired by embattled farmers at invading armies. They haven?t been fired by terrorists who?ve penetrated our surveillance and security systems. With few exceptions, they haven?t been fired by aggrieved non-white Americans. They?ve been fired mostly by young, white American citizens at other white citizens, and by American soldiers at other American soldiers, inside the very institutions where republican virtues and beliefs are nurtured and defended.</p>
<p>They?ve been fired from within a body politic so drained of candor and trust that, beneath our continuing lip-service to republican premises and practices, we?ve let a court conflate the free speech of flesh-and-blood citizens with the disembodied wealth of anonymous shareholders. And we?ve let lawmakers, bought or intimidated by gun peddlers and zealots, render us helpless against torrents of marketed fear and vengeance that are dissolving a distinctively American democratic ethos the literary historian? Daniel Aaron? characterized as ?ethical and pragmatic, disciplined and free.?</p>
<p>Many Americans are adapting to living with variants of force and fraud that erupt in road rage; lethal stampedes by shoppers on sale days; security precautions in their homes against the prospect of armed invasion; gladiatorialization and corruption in sports; nihilism in entertainment that fetishizes violence without context and sex without attachment ; the casino-like financing of utterly unproductive economic activities such as the entertainment I''ve just mentioned and the predatory lending that has tricked millions out of their homes; the commercial groping and goosing of private lives and public spaces, even in the marketing of ordinary consumer goods; and the huge, new prison industry that Americans have created to deter or punish broken, violent men, most of them non-white, only to find schools in even the whitest, ?safest? neighborhoods imprisoned by fear of white gunmen who?ve often been students themselves.</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>Abroad, meanwhile, thousands more shots, fiendish and celebratory, are being fired into the corpses of American national-security and nation-building projects by terrorists and fanatics we were told had been decimated. These projects cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, limbs, homes and hopes, including those of American soldiers, contractors and idealists. Their sacrifices can?t justify retroactively what shouldn?t have been undertaken in the first place.</p>
<p>Stressed by all this republican derangement, millions are spending billions on palliatives, medications, addictions and even surveillance designed to protect them from themselves. All those vials, syringes, security systems and shootings reflect the insinuation of what Gibbon called ?a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire?? until Roman citizens ?no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from the will of their sovereign, and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.? Only a few late-Roman republicans, recalling their old freedoms, concluded, with Livy, that ?We have become too ill to bear our sickness or their cures.?</p>
<p>What went wrong?</p>
                    
                    
    
<p>You might argue, and quite rightly, that ?We, the people? have always subverted the truths we?d held to be self-evident, beginning with slavery and continuing with plutocracy. Yet somehow the republic kept experiencing what Lincoln called ?a new birth of freedom," thanks only partly to the fortuitous confluence of two oceans? protection, a vast continent?s ever-alluring frontier and unending streams of aspiring immigrants:</p>
<p>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame<br />
 With conquering limbs astride from land to land,<br />
 Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates will stand<br />
 A mighty woman with a torch<br />
 Whose flame is the imprisoned lightning,<br />
 And her name: Mother of Exiles</p>

And it still had a guiding aristocracy of sorts, but supposedly only "an aristocracy of talent and virtue," as Jefferson put it, and not one of blood and ill-gotten wealth.?True, too, certain lingering Puritan beliefs had nourished in the embattled farmers (and, even long before 1775, in some of the Puritans themselves) a conviction that resistance to tyranny is obedience to God. That injunction to defy worldly power sometimes in the name of a Higher Power legitimated individual conscience and autonomy right up through the nonviolent defiance of the best of the civil-rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. But the American emphasis on individual conscience and autonomy also gestated a liberal capitalist republic that has reduced individualism to market exchanges in ways that are now destroying both individuals and the society. A liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily certain public virtues and beliefs that neither the liberal state nor markets can nourish or defend. The liberal state isn?t supposed to judge between one way of life and another, after all; and markets reward you as a self-interested consumer and investor, not as a citizen who might put such interests aside at times to advance a greater good that self-interest alone can''t achieve. The moral silence and often bankruptcy of states and markets leaves citizen-leaders to be nourished and trained all the more intensively in institutions that stand somewhat apart from the state and markets. The Puritan founders of America?s oldest colleges understood this, but they expected that those colleges'' graduates would serve a theocratic state that would control markets and everything else.?We?re right to dismiss the Puritans? theocracy because it was repressive and hypocritical. But we''re wrong to have lost a side of its animating spirit that would have kept markets from controlling and devouring republican government and even our bodies and ourselves. Symptoms and scapegoats hide the disease Having miscarried republican self-discipline and conviction so badly, we find ourselves scrambling to monitor, measure and control the consequences, such as the proliferation of mental illness and the glorification and marketing of guns, as if these were causing our implosion. They aren?t. They?re symptoms, not causes -- reactions to widespread heartbreak at the breakdown of what Tocqueville called republican habits of the heart that we used to cultivate. Equally symptomatic, not causal, are self-avowedly ?deviant? and ?transgressive? gyrations by people who imagine that the sunset of civic-republican order heralds a liberating, Dionysian dawn. Sloughing off our bad old repressions, we?ve been swept up by the swift market currents that turn countercultures into over-the-counter cultures and promote a free-for-all that?s a free-for-none as citizens become customers chasing ?freedoms? for sale. Even our war-makers? and -mongers? grand strategies and the growing militarization of our domestic police forces are more symptomatic than causal of the public derangement that''s rising all around us. But turning the bearers of such frightening symptoms into our primary villains or scapegoats would only deepen our blindness to the disease, which is as old as the biblical worship of the Golden Calf and as new as Goldman Sachs. It runs deeper than anything that anyone but the Puritans and their Old Testament models tried to tackle. I''m not suggesting we can or should return to Puritanism! Anyone expecting to recover that faith and way of life is stumbling up dry streambeds toward wellsprings that have themselves run dry. But we do need wellsprings that could fortify us to take risks even more daunting than those taken by the embattled farmers. We''d somehow have to reconfigure or abandon empty comforts, escapes and protections that both free-market conservatives and readers of Salon are accustomed to buying and selling, sometimes against our own best hopes and convictions. Our cure would also require reweaving a fabric of public candor and comity strong enough to resist the rise of?ressentiment, a public psychopathology, once associated with the rise of fascism, in which insecurities, envy and hatreds that many have been nursing in private converge in scary public eruptions that diminish their participants even in seeming to make them big.?Ressentiment?s??little-big man? seeks easy targets for frustrations borne of exploitation by powers that he''s afraid to face and reckon with head-on. Blaming scapegoats warps his assessment of his hardships and options and drives him to wreak vengeance on them as soon as there are enough little-big men (and women, of course) to do so?en masse?under a Glenn Beck or a Sarah Palin. Whether?ressentiment?erupts in racist violence, sectarian fanaticism, anti-Communist witch hunts, totalitarian show trials, politically correct cultural revolutions or sadistic escapism, its most telling symptoms are paranoia and routinized bursts of hysteria. Under the ministrations of gifted demagogues, its grievances and pain assume a fleeting brilliance that soon collapses, tragi-comically or catastrophically, on its own cowardice and lies. Its targets often shift. The 9/11 attacks brought a reprieve of sorts to African-Americans, the republic?s most enduring scapegoats, when the burden of white censure pivoted toward Muslims. Louis Farrakhan?s Nation of Islam lost credibility, but so did whites such as the neoconservative Daniel Pipes, who kept on insisting years after 9/11 that the first black president was a Muslim and a friend of terrorists. The slipperiness of scapegoating became clear to me in 1993, as I?wrote?about a deranged black gunman, Colin Ferguson, who?d opened fire in a Long Island Rail Road car, killing six passengers. Even while holding him responsible, I saw him bearing symptoms far more widespread than his private demons. Noting Ferguson?s enthusiasm for a politics of rage, paranoia and death threats then prominent on a black radio station and in demagogic street politics, I warned that even deranged loners are sometimes better attuned to our subconscious hatreds and fears than we care to admit.?That was true, too, of?Jared Loughner,?the white paranoid-schizophrenic and anti-government fantasist who killed a U.S. District Court judge and six other people while trying to kill but severely wounding U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 13 others in 2011. While apocalyptic religious and racist ranting can provoke emotionally disturbed people, so can journalism and entertainment that massage hatreds too diffuse to be called racist, religious or ideological. Some school shooters nursed the depictions of violence and lust that are?pumped incessantly?into young Americans? horizons with the help of new technologies and investment strategies that ride reckless misreadings of the First Amendment.?This hasn?t been done with malevolent intent as often as it?s been done in a kind of civic mindlessness by media corporations incentivized and indeed forced by market pressures to bypass our brains and hearts on the way to our lower viscera and wallets by exaggerating fears of armed home invasion, government takeover and vengeful victory by gunplay. The invisible disease Even though relatively few young Americans follow these siren songs into acts of destruction, the public fetishizing of sex and violence without context or caring dampens many others? faith in society during their formative years. You don?t need to know a lot of developmental psychology or anthropology to know that children crave culturally coherent tests of prowess and loyalty in symbolic rites of passage that ratify their communal belonging. When such rites and symbols fail, some flail about, seeking order in private delusions, Dartmouth College fraternities and public orchestrations of?ressentiment. In 1775, most American communities still filtered such basic generational and human needs through traditions that encompassed kinship bonds and seasonal rhythms. In "Common Sense," Thomas Paine could urge readers to take their recent experiences of monarchy ?to the touchstones of nature? and decide whether they would abide the empire''s abuses.?Today, those "touchstones of nature" -- and with them, republican convictions about selfhood and society -- have been torn up by runaway engines and developments in technology, communications and even intimate biology that would terrify Paine, Adam Smith and John Locke, not to mention those who fired the first shot at Concord. This time, we''re all in bed with the enemy. In "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" 40 years ago, Daniel Bell -- no anti-capitalist, but prophetic enough about the worship of Golden Calves -- argued that free markets no longer make free men because "economic liberalism has become? corporate oligopoly, and, in the pursuit of private wants, a hedonism that is destructive of social needs." He warned that consumer capitalism displaces the needs that the early republic filtered through nature?s rhythms and kinship traditions. It displaces those needs with ginned-up ?wants? that ?by their nature, are unlimited and insatiable?. [T]he rational calculation of efficiency and return? displace ?the principle of the public household," strip-mining and selling off fragments of cultural narratives. Without civic wellsprings and narratives deep and compelling enough to strengthen a society?s adhesives and disciplines in the hearts of its young, neither free-market conservatives nor world-is-flat neoliberal cosmopolitans can reconcile their professed commitments to ordered, republican liberty with their knee-jerk obedience to riptides of destructive investment that are dissolving republican virtue and sovereignty before our eyes. No wonder we?re losing our vision, in both senses of the word: Our foreign-policy savants across the ideological spectrum were too blind to see that the Soviet Union was so much weaker than American Cold War propaganda and hysteria insisted that it imploded in 1989. The fabled "missile gap" that John F. Kennedy ran on in 1960 was as imaginary as Saddam Hussein''s WMD, but anyone who tried telling either of those truths was charged with a ?failure of nerve? or worse by the blind warmongers in our midst. Our business press was too blind to see that a tsunami of predatory lending would wreck the national economy and throw millions from their homes. Our market-addled congressional committees and blue-ribbon commissions on national intelligence couldn?t discover, until Edward Snowden revealed it, that public surveillance had taken on an all-devouring life of its own. Neoconservative and Vulcan conservative advocates of using American military force to spread democracy abroad couldn?t see that their strategy was doomed because democracy isn''t woven that way and because it was destroying democracy at home in ways that, if unchecked, will destroy the republic whose strengths they''ve so badly misconstrued and betrayed. Our consumer society, addicted to cheap comforts and quick fixes, can''t see its own Orwellian ensnarement by commercial censors, and it couldn?t take Al Gore?s "Inconvenient Truth? about global warming seriously enough to offset the onrushing damage with the serious sacrifices we have yet to make. Our gilded political consultants, pollsters and campaign donors were too blind to see the boiling undercurrents that have swept away House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Nor can they see that Cantor?s political demise presages an inflammation of?ressentiment?so wild that the coming, specious, ?Who Lost Iraq?? debate will be accompanied by the shot that some military veteran who feels betrayed will fire at a politician who?s been left holding the empty bag of our civic-republican hopes. So we are flying almost totally blind, punched bloody by a Hand that we keep insisting is Invisible. We can see only the sickness of the gunmen and of the proliferation of their guns. Treatment of those symptoms is urgently needed, but it will be insufficient to curb the wrecking ball that global capitalism has become on our willfully blind watch, and triage won''t renew the civic fabric. Exemplary defiance has its place Whenever republican candor and courage have seemed about to succumb like this to tribal and theocratic delusions or to force and fraud in the past, some citizens have roused others to fend off threats to republican premises and practices: In 1776 a young schoolteacher named Nathan Hale was caught trying to track and expose the military and intelligence operations of the only established, legitimate government of his time. But just before his hanging he said, ?I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country? and became an incarnation of a nascent republic. Hale''s dignity in adversity, unfathomable to many of us these days, anticipated that of Martin Luther King Jr. and the black churchgoers who walked unarmed and trembling toward armed men and dogs with nothing but their faith and their long-shot strategy to delegitimate the seemingly impregnable segregationist establishment of their time by appealing to republican principles and an American civil religion whose theology was as vague as that of the founders. Hale?s dignity also anticipated that of three Yale seniors I came upon one wintry morning in 1968 as they gave university chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. their military draft cards to announce their resistance to the U.S. government on behalf of the American republic. ?The government says we?re criminals, but we say the government is criminal for waging this war,? said one of the seniors, struggling to find his voice. For all we knew, these guys were about to be arrested on the spot, and some of us felt arrested morally by their example because they were ready to pay the penalty of law in order to affirm their commitment to honest law itself. Coffin, who held to a Calvinist theology that, like King?s, saw resistance to tyranny as obedience to God, was present to bless a courage that few national-security state conservatives understand, in the idiom of an American civil religion few neoliberals and postmodern leftists understand. When he quoted Dylan Thomas? ?Do not go gentle into that good night; rage, rage, against the dying of the light,? that civil religion seemed to awaken briefly and to walk and talk again, re-moralizing the state and the law, and the silent, wild confusion I was feeling gave way to something like awe. (I described this experience?in The Washington Monthly in 2000, during the protracted ?election? of George W. Bush.) Hale?s courage also anticipated Edward Snowden?s. Both young men may have been impetuous and otherwise flawed in some respects, but they showed that resistance to corrupted power requires not only prowess, means, and will, but an elusive, republican sensibility that?s cultivated in civil society and confirmed in little daily interactions long before it emerges in demonstrations of civic courage that startle and move other citizens. With a wonderment somewhat like Hegel?s, the German political philosopher J?rgen Habermas marveled at this ?constitutional patriotism? in American citizens who possessed what Gibbon described as ?that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honor, the presence of danger, and the habit of command.? When I tell young millennials these stories, though, many of them listen pretty much as they would to tales about knights in shining armor, long ago and far away. Much closer to them are the school shootings and internet mayhem that make brave citizenship seem archaic, implausible and irrelevant to self-discovery and social change. Yet republican expectations do have ways of resurfacing whenever ?We, the people? begin to imagine what our lives would be like, singly and together, if we had to live without them. Not everyone can be seduced or intimidated away from them. Still, so many Americans are generations removed from any easily recoverable religious or ethno-racial identity or other adhesive that we have to ask: Where are the touchstones or narratives strong enough renew public virtues and beliefs that neither markets nor the liberal state do much to nourish or defend? Nourishing a new liberal order The question should prompt a quest for a political culture that isn?t too commercial and vapid and that isn''t held together only by demagoguery and delusion. No reconfiguration of today?s capitalism will be possible without something better than that. Yet no think tank, legislature or foundation can carry that quest or that reconfiguration to a just conclusion. Nor can an Occupy Wall Street that isn?t grounded in something deeper than its own noble effort to?be?the change it wants us all to make. Nor can our ?illness? be cured by champions of a new foreign-policy??realism? such as Robert Kagan, who?urge us to face the inevitable challenges?of a world where only willpower and force can sustain the liberal order that many Americans take for granted. That?s right as far as it goes,?but it begs the question of where willpower comes from and what, within the liberal order itself, is sapping that willpower. Quoting Michael Ignatieff, Kagan speculates candidly that liberal civilization itself ?runs deeply against the human grain and is achieved and sustained only by the most unremitting struggle against human nature.? Perhaps, Kagan adds, ?this fragile democratic garden requires the protection of a liberal world order, with constant feeding, watering, weeding, and the fencing off of an ever-encroaching jungle.? But he can?t seem to face the challenge posed by the new shots heard ?round the world from America: The jungle and its encroachments begin not only abroad but within our own garden. What seems our greatest weakness could be one of our greatest strengths, although it, too, won''t be enough: Even 150 years after the founding, the philosopher George Santayana?wrote?that Americans still heralded the Enlightenment?s entry into history precisely because they?d ?all been uprooted from their several soils and ancestries and plunged together into one vortex, whirling irresistible in a space otherwise quite empty. To be an American is of itself almost a moral condition, an education and a career?.? Although there?s plenty to regret and respect in the traditions we?ve lost, there?s no turning back from the ?moral condition? and ?career? we face as citizens. We have no choice but to keep faith with the republic and one another. If Americans have a manifest destiny now, it?s to lead in weaving a new republican fabric that markets can serve but not subvert. In 2008, Barack Obama seemed to incarnate so brilliantly the promise of weaving our diversity into a new republican discipline -- he even invoked Puritan and biblical wellsprings in some of his speeches -- that many people ?round the world considered him a prophet who would satisfy their hunger for new narratives. Probably no national political leader ever can do that. The narratives the world needs now will have to come from other prophets and leaders yet unsung. I do think that Americans will be strong among them, if only because we?ve had so much experience generating that hunger by generating the civic-republican-capitalist effort that has failed.', 28851, N'no longer possessed that public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the ...', N'Our republic is in crisis — and it’s killing us.
